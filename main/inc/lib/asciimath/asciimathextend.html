<h2>ASCIIMathML.js: Extending the symbol table</h2>

<p>
The standard symbol table of ASCIIMathML.js does not contain many symbols.
It can be extended by adding additional symbols on any webpage that 
requires them. This is done by adding a few lines of JavaScript code.

</p>

<p>
For example, suppose we want to add symbols for "not less or equal" and
"not greater or equal".
</p>

<p>
We first have to find the four-digit hexadecimal Unicode value for
these symbols by looking them up at, say, <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/chapter6.html#chars.entity.tables">http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/chapter6.html#chars.entity.tables</a>
</p>

<p>
Next we have to decide what input strings we want to associate with these
symbols, say "!<=" and "!>=".
</p>

<p>
Finally we add the following lines to the head or body of our HTML file:
<pre style="border-style:groove">&lt;script type="text/javascript">
define("!<=","\u2270")
define("!>=","\u2271")
&lt;/script>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Here we test the modified symbol table: 
<tt>\`a !<= b !>= c\`</tt> produces `a !<= b !>= c`
</p>

<p>To add a symbol to the LaTeX commands, use the following alternate syntax:
<pre style="border-style:groove">&lt;script type="text/javascript">
newcommand("\\nle","\u2270")
newcommand("\\nge","\u2271")
&lt;/script>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Now 
<tt>\$a \nle b \nge c\$</tt> produces $a \nle b \nge c$.
</p>

<hr/>
<p>
If you know the numeric entity reference of the symbol you want to use
on an ASCIIMathML webpage, you can also refer to the symbol directly
by using that reference. E.g \`&amp;#x2270;\` produces `&#x2270;`.
If a symbol is only used occasionally, this is certainly the simplest
way to include it.
