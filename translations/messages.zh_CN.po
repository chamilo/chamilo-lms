In contrast to e-mail, a forum is for public, or semi-public, group discussion. </p>To use the Chamilo forum, members can simply use their browser - they do not require any distinct client software. </p>To organize forums, click on the Forums tool. Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>"

The change of this option will not affect the directories structure on disk, but will affect the behaviour of the Chamilo code, so if you change this option, you have to create the new directories and move the existing directories by yourself on te server. Be aware that when creating and moving those directories, you will have to move the directories of users 1 to 9 into subdirectories of the same name.

msgid "OpenID eliminates the need for multiple logins across different websites, simplifying your online experience. You get to choose the OpenID Provider that best meets your needs and most importantly that you trust. At the same time, your OpenID can stay with you, no matter which Provider you move to. And best of all, the OpenID technology is not proprietary and is completely free.For businesses, this means a lower cost of password and account management, while drawing new web traffic. OpenID lowers user frustration by letting users have control of their login.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://openid.net/what/\">Read on...</a>"
msgstr "OpenID可以消除在不同网站不同帐户登录的要求，简化了您的在线体验。您可以选择自己的OpenID，并使用可相信的OpenID供应商。最重要的是，OpenID技术并不是私有的，完全免费使用。对于商业方面，这意味着当使用新的网络通信时，使用较低成本就能维护帐户和密码管理。OpenID使得用户能自己控制登录来减少多帐户的烦恼"

In contrast to e-mail, a forum is for public, or semi-public, group discussion. </p>To use the Chamilo forum, members can simply use their browser - they do not require any distinct client software. </p>To organize forums, click on the Forums tool. Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and is not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>"

msgid "The Course tool supports two approaches :<ul><li>Create a new course (allowing you to author your own content)</li><li>Import SCORM course</li></ul><img src=\"../img/path_help.gif\"><p><b>What is a Learning Path?</b></p><p>A Learning Path allows for the presentation of a sequence of learning experiences or activities arranged in distinct sections (in this sense, the Learning Path is what distinguishes a 'course' from a mere repository of random documents). It can be content-based (serving as a table of contents) or activities-based, serving as an agenda or program of action necessary to understand and apply a particular area of knowledge or skill.</p><p>In addition to being  structured, a Learning Path can also be <i>sequential</i>, meaning that the completion of certain steps constitute pre-requisites for accessing others (i.e. 'you cannot go to learning object 2 before learning object 1'). Your sequence can be <i>suggestive</i> (simply displaying steps one after the other) or <i>prescriptive</i> (involving pre-requisites so that learners are required to follow steps in a particular order).</p><p><b>How do I create my own Learning Path (Course)?</b></p><p>Proceed to the 'Learning Path' section.  There you can create as many courses/paths as you wish by clicking the <i>Create a new course</i> tool. You will need to choose a name for the course/path (e.g. <i>Unit 1</i> if you plan to create several units within the overall course). To begin with, the course is empty, waiting for you to add sections and learning objects to it.<br>If you set a course to Visible, it will appear as a new tool on the course homepage. This makes it easier and clearer for students to access.</p><p><b>What learning objects can I add?</b></p><p>All Chamilo tools, activities and content that you consider useful and relevant to your course can be added :<br><ul><li>Separate documents (texts, pictures, Office docs, ...)</li><li>Forums as a whole</li><li>Topics</li><li>Links</li><li>Chamilo Tests</li><li>HotPotatoes Tests<br />(note :tests made invisible on the homepage, but included in a path, become visible for learners only as they work through the course.)</li><li>Assignments</li><li>External links</li></ul></p><p><b>Other features</b></p><p>Learners can be asked to follow your course in a given order, as you can set <u>pre-requisites</u>. This means for example that learners cannot go to e.g. Quiz 2 until they have read e.g. Document 1. All learning objects have a status:<i>completed</i> or <i>incomplete</i>, so the progress of learners is clearly reported.</p><p>If you alter the original title of a learning object, the new name will appear in the course, but the original title will not be deleted. So if you want test8.doc to appear as 'Final Exam' in the path, you do not have to rename the file, you can use the new title in the path. It is also useful to give new titles to links which are too long.</p><p>When you're finished, don't forget to check Display mode, (showing, as in learner view, the table of contents on the left and the learning objects on the right,one at a time.)</p><br><p><b>What is a SCORM course and how do I import one?</b></p><p>The learning path tool allows you to upload SCORM-compliant courses.</p><p>SCORM  (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) is a public standard followed by major e-Learning companies like NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft, etc. They act at three levels:</p><ul><li><b>Economy</b> : SCORM renders whole courses or small content units reusable on different Learning Management Systems (LMS) through the separation of content and context,</li><li><b>Pedagogy</b> : SCORM integrates the notion of pre-requisite or <i>sequencing</i> (<i>e.g. </i>\"You cannot go to chapter 2 before passing Quiz 1\"),</li><li><b>Technology</b> : SCORM generates a table of contents as an abstraction layer located outside the content and the LMS. It helps both communicate with each other. Mainly communicated are <i>bookmarks</i>(\"Where is John in the course?\"), <i>scoring</i> (\"How did John pass the test?\") and <i>time</i> (\"How much time did John spent in chapter 1?\").</li></ul><b>How can I create a SCORM-compliant Learning Path?</b><br><br>The obvious way is to use the Chamilo Authoring tool. However, you may prefer to create complete SCORM compliant websites locally on your own computer before uploading it onto your Chamilo platform. In this case, we recommend the use of a sophisticated tool such as Lectora®, eXe Learning® or Reload®<br></p><p>"

You will find the dedicated Survey tool invaluable for getting effective feedback from users. </p> <p><b>Creating a new survey</b></p> <p> Click on the link 'Create a new survey' and fill in the fields 'Survey code' and 'Survey title'. With the help of the calendar, you can control the duration of your survey. There's no need to keep it open for a whole year; allow access for a few days at the end of the course program. Filling in the text fields 'Survey introduction' and 'Survey thanks' is also good practice; this will add clarity and a certain friendliness to your survey.</p> <p><b>Adding questions to the survey</b></p> <p>Once the survey outline is created, it is up to you to create the questions. The 'Survey' tool has many question types: open/closed questions, percentage, QCM, multiple responses... You should certainly find everything you need for your (ever increasing) feedback requirements.</p>  <p><b>Previewing the survey</b></p><p>Once you have created questions, you may want to check what the survey will look like to learners. Click on the 'Preview' icon and the preview screen will show you exactly this.</p> <p><b>Publishing the survey</b></p> <p>Happy with the preview? Any modifications to be made? No? Then click on the icon 'Publish survey' to send the survey to the selected list of recipients. As with creating groups, use the list 'Users of this course' on the left and the one for 'receivers' on its right to arrange this. Next, fill in the e-mail subject 'Title of the e-mail' and the content, 'Text of the e-mail'. Potential surveyees will be alerted by e-mail of the availability of a survey. Think carefully about  the wording of the e-mail  because it will play a big part in motivating users to take the survey.</p>  <p><b>Survey reports</b></p> Analysing surveys is a tedious task. The survey Reporting tool will help with analysis as it sorts reports according to question, user, comparisons etc...  <p><b>Managing surveys</b></p> When managing surveys you will see some new icons, apart from the usual 'Edit' and 'Delete' options. You can preview, publish and keep track of your surveys and responses using these.</p>"
