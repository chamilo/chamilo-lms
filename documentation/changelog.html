<h1>Dokeos 1.8.6.1 <span style="font-style: italic;">(Babel?)</span> - August 2009</h1>
<h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
<p>Dokeos 1.8.6.1 is a minor&nbsp;release including just a few new features, mostly focused on internationalization.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Improvements in document tool, allow seeing glossary terms (FS#4337)</li>
  <li>Improvements in SCORM export(FS#4300)</li>
  <li>At the beginning of the installation script an imperative check for PHP 5 has been added. (FS#4296)</li>
  <li>When the system Dokeos is switched into "Test server" mode, a clickable indicator appears in the footer. This indicator is visible by platform administrators only. (FS#4341)</li>
  <li>A transliteration function has been added. Currently, it is used in uploading files. Files with non-English names get names that contain ASCII letters only, remaining readable in the corresponding language. Rationale: The PHP5 run-time environment does not manage file name encodings, adding such a non-native feature involves too much work. For avoiding character encoding problems, transliteration of file names is the possible solution. (FS#306)</li>
  <li>An internationalization option has been added for improving sorting in arbitrary language. When the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php" target="_blank">intl</a> php-extension has been installed, various sorting routines exploit it for better sorting. Rationale: The PHP5 run-time environment does not provide native and reliable way of sorting UTF-8 strings. (FS#306)</li>
  <li>The installation sript: The page about system requilements has been updated. Also, at the very beginning, a check has been added whether the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php" target="_blank">mbstring</a> php-extension is installed - see <a href="http://dokeos.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=29548" target="_blank">the related forum topic</a>. (FS#306)</li>
  <li>A new php-based configuration for the online editor has been implemented, see <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/myconfig.php</i>. Also, toolbar definitions have been split in separate php-files within the directory <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/toolbars/</i> . Customization of the editor is more convenient and flexible now. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>The online editor: A upgrade from FCKEditor 2.6.4 to <b>FCKEditor 2.6.4.1</b> has been implemented. (FS#4383)</li>
  <li>The online editor: Several known bug-fixes from FCKEditor 2.6.5 SVN have been implemented, tickets <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2821" target="_blank">#2821</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2856" target="_blank">#2856</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2915" target="_blank">#2915</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3120" target="_blank">#3120</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3181" target="_blank">#3181</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3429" target="_blank">#3429</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3439" target="_blank">#3439</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3880" target="_blank">#3880</a>. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>The online editor: The <b>simple file manager</b> has been integrated with the editor's dialog system. Thus, the simple file manager works faster and in a more secure way. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>The online editor: Blocking copy/paste for trainees has been added. The feature is configurable through editing the toolbar definition files within the directory <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/toolbars/</i> . (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>The online editor: Preview tabs have been added to the dialogs for inserting video, flv-video, and YouTube video. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>The online editor: The <b>audio</b> plugin has been activated by default as an implementation of the "Insert audio / Audio properties" dialog. This new plugin is intended to replace the "MP3" plugin. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>The online editor: Configuration of the <b>mimetex</b> plugin has been reworked to gain simplicity. The procedure for configuration has been updated, see <a href="http://www.dokeos.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=29594" target="_blank">the related forum topic</a>. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>The online editor: The toolbar icons have been upgraded to those from CKEditor 3.0. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>A solution has been implemented for fixing the <a href="http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-529" target="_blank">"__flash__removeCallback" bug</a>, which affects the media player on Internet Explorer browser. (FS#4378 and FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Implement new sub-language feature by which language terms redefinition becomes possible through the admin section (FS#4321)</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<br />
<h3>Deprecated files</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The whole main/inc/lib/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/browser/default/connectors/ directory should be removed for security reasons</li> 
</ul>

    		<li>iCal import and export of course events, with a choice of public, private or confidential markers</li>
    		<li>Repetitive
course events can be created (and exported to iCal). Repetitions types
supported are: daily, weekly, monthly by date (e.g. the 5th of each
month) and yearly by date</li>
   		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Document templates have been greatly improved to speed-up custom course content creation</li>
	<li>Audiorecorder
(depending on streaming server) now records sounds in the
document/audio directory, making them easily reusable by the course
admin</li>
	<li>Audiorecorder is not loaded by default (took too long) and you can load it with a simple click</li>
	<li>W3C - Compliance with XHTML 1.0 Transitional has been improved</li>
	<li>Tracking - A new page to display access details by user is available under the Reporting tab, in the user details in a course</li>
	<li>Removed header from learning path tool. It was taking too much space and was not flexible enough for CSS styling</li>
	<li>Improved speed of 1.6 to 1.8 migration by adding indexes</li>
    </ul>
<br />
<h3>Debugging</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Prerequisites management in learning paths fixed (includes quizzes, hotpotatoes and SCORM)</li>

    <li>Bugfix:
registering a new user resulted in the language field of the user being
empty which resulted in an english profile by default. This has now
been changed to the platform language. </li>
    <li>Performance improvement in the user list of the platform administration </li>
	<li>Bugfix: group tutors were not migrated from 1.6 to 1.8</li>

	<li>Documentation is now fully XHTML 1.0 Transitional compliant</li>
	<li>Fix FCKeditor Flash upload lack of usability and problems with IE</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Audiorecorder takes a few seconds to write the audio file
back to the document directory, so the page shouldn't be changed too
quickly after recording a sound track</li>
    <li>When migrating from 1.6 to 1.8, some SCORM learning paths might need to be re-imported, which means their tracking is lost</li>
</ul>
