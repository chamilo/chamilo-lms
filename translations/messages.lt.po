In contrast to e-mail, a forum is for public, or semi-public, group discussion. </p>To use the Chamilo forum, members can simply use their browser - they do not require any distinct client software. </p>To organize forums, click on the Forums tool. Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>"

msgid "OpenID eliminates the need for multiple logins across different websites, simplifying your online experience. You get to choose the OpenID Provider that best meets your needs and most importantly that you trust. At the same time, your OpenID can stay with you, no matter which Provider you move to. And best of all, the OpenID technology is not proprietary and is completely free.For businesses, this means a lower cost of password and account management, while drawing new web traffic. OpenID lowers user frustration by letting users have control of their login.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://openid.net/what/\">Read on...</a>"

In contrast to e-mail, a forum is for public, or semi-public, group discussion. </p>To use the Chamilo forum, members can simply use their browser - they do not require any distinct client software. </p>To organize forums, click on the Forums tool. Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and is not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>"

By\n default, the Chamilo forum only contains the category 'Public', a sample\n forum and a sample topic.</p><p>The first thing you should do is deleting\n the sample topic and modify the first forum name. Then, you can\n create, in the 'public' category, other forums, by by themes, to\n fit your learning scenario requirements.</p><p>Don't mix Categories and\n forums, and don't forget that an empty category (without forums) does not\n appear on the student view.</p><p>The description of a forum can be the\n list of its members, the definition of a goal, a task, a theme...</p>\n <p>Group forums should not be created through Forum tool but through Groups tool. There you will be allowed to decide whether your group forums are private or public.</p>\n <b>Pedagogically advanced use</b>\n <p>Some teachers / trainers use the forum to post corrections.

This way you keep control of who is registered while avoiding the administrative hassle of registering them yourself.</p>(Note - some organizations prefer not to use this method and opt to centralise registration. In this case, participants cannot enrol in your course at all, even if you, as a trainer / teacher, wish to give them access. To check this, look at the home page of your campus (as opposed to your course homepage) to see if the 'Register' link is present.) </p> <p>At the bottom of the page, you can back up the course and delete it. Backup will create a file on the server and allow you to copy it on your own Hard Disk locally so that there will be two backups each in different places. If you back up a course and then delete it you will not be be able to restore it yourself, but the system administrator can do this for you if you give him/her the code of your course. Backing up a course is also a good way to get all your documents transferred to your own computer. You will need a tool, like Winzip® to UNZIP the archive.

With the help of the calendar, you can control the duration of your survey. There's no need to keep it open for a whole year; allow access for a few days at the end of the course program. Filling in the text fields 'Survey introduction' and 'Survey thanks' is also good practice; this will add clarity and a certain friendliness to your survey.</p> <p><b>Adding questions to the survey</b></p> <p>Once the survey outline is created, it is up to you to create the questions. The 'Survey' tool has many question types: open/closed questions, percentage, QCM, multiple responses... You should certainly find everything you need for your (ever increasing) feedback requirements.</p>  <p><b>Previewing the survey</b></p><p>Once you have created questions, you may want to check what the survey will look like to learners. Click on the 'Preview' icon and the preview screen will show you exactly this.</p> <p><b>Publishing the survey</b></p> <p>Happy with the preview? Any modifications to be made? No? Then click on the icon 'Publish survey' to send the survey to the selected list of recipients. As with creating groups, use the list 'Users of this course' on the left and the one for 'receivers' on its right to arrange this. Next, fill in the e-mail subject 'Title of the e-mail' and the content, 'Text of the e-mail'. Potential surveyees will be alerted by e-mail of the availability of a survey. Think carefully about  the wording of the e-mail  because it will play a big part in motivating users to take the survey.</p>  <p><b>Survey reports</b></p> Analysing surveys is a tedious task. The survey Reporting tool will help with analysis as it sorts reports according to question, user, comparisons etc...  <p><b>Managing surveys</b></p> When managing surveys you will see some new icons, apart from the usual 'Edit' and 'Delete' options. You can preview, publish and keep track of your surveys and responses using these.</p>"
