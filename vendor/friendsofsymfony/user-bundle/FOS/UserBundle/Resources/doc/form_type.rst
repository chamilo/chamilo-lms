The username Form Type
======================

FOSUserBundle provides a convenient username form type, named ``fos_user_username``.
It appears as a text input, accepts usernames and convert them to a User
instance::

    class MessageFormType extends AbstractType
    {
        public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
        {
            $builder->add('recipient', 'fos_user_username');
        }
    }

.. note::

    If you don't use this form type in your app, you can disable it to remove
    the service from the container:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config.yml
        fos_user:
            use_username_form_type: false
