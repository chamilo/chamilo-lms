/**
 * This script removes duplicated tests and questions created
 * through something gone wrong in the course backup/copy process.
 * It identifies duplicate documents by title, path and size, and
 * makes sure no usage is associated with the duplicated document, and
 * that the duplicated document is not used in a learning path.
 * A duplicated document will generally match the following criteria:
 * - same size as the original
 * - same path and title with the addition of a _%d (int) suffix to the basename (before the file extension) (unlikely to ever be > 9, so one digit is enough)
 * - same course, same session (otherwise considered a different file, a voluntary copy)
 * - each have entries in c_item_property because it was created legitimately
 * Possible duplicates can be found with a query like:
 * SELECT id, size, title, path FROM c_document WHERE c_id = 470 AND path like '%\__.%' ORDER BY path, title;
 * This script should be located inside the tests/scripts/ folder to work.
 * It can be run more than one time as it will only ever affect duplicate
 * documents.
 * If you have a very large number of documents, we recommend you temporarily
 * comment out the api_item_property_update() calls in
 * DocumentManager::deleteDocumentFromDb.
 * Chances are there is not even a registry of those documents there in the
 * first place (they were probably duplicated through a short process) and
 * this is where most of the time is spent during deletion.
