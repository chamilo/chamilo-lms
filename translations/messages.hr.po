In contrast to e-mail, a forum is for public, or semi-public, group discussion. </p>To use the Chamilo forum, members can simply use their browser - they do not require any distinct client software. </p>To organize forums, click on the Forums tool. Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>"

The change of this option will not affect the directories structure on disk, but will affect the behaviour of the Chamilo code, so if you change this option, you have to create the new directories and move the existing directories by yourself on te server.

You get to choose the OpenID Provider that best meets your needs and most importantly that you trust. At the same time, your OpenID can stay with you, no matter which Provider you move to. And best of all, the OpenID technology is not proprietary and is completely free.For businesses, this means a lower cost of password and account management, while drawing new web traffic. OpenID lowers user frustration by letting users have control of their login.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://openid.net/what/\">Read on...</a>"
msgstr "OpenID uklanja potrebu za otvaranje višestrukih korisničkih imena za različite Internet stranice (portale), pojednostavljajući vaš boravak na Internetu. Odaberite OpenID davatelja usluge koji odgovara vašim potrebama i u kojeg imate povjerenje. Ukoliko i promjenite davatelja OpenID usluge vaš otvoreni OpenID prenosite sa sobom. OpenID je besplatna tehnologija bez ikakvih licenci ili vlasništva. U poslovnom svijetu to znači manji troškovi u administriranju korisničkih računa i zaporki.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://openid.net/what/\">Više na...</a>"

msgid "<p> The forum is an discussion tool for asynchronous written work.  In contrast to e-mail, a forum is for public, or semi-public, group discussion. </p>To use the Chamilo forum, members can simply use their browser - they do not require any distinct client software. </p>To organize forums, click on the Forums tool. Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and is not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>"

msgid "The Course tool supports two approaches :<ul><li>Create a new course (allowing you to author your own content)</li><li>Import SCORM course</li></ul><img src=\"../img/path_help.gif\"><p><b>What is a Learning Path?</b></p><p>A Learning Path allows for the presentation of a sequence of learning experiences or activities arranged in distinct sections (in this sense, the Learning Path is what distinguishes a 'course' from a mere repository of random documents). It can be content-based (serving as a table of contents) or activities-based, serving as an agenda or program of action necessary to understand and apply a particular area of knowledge or skill.</p><p>In addition to being  structured, a Learning Path can also be <i>sequential</i>, meaning that the completion of certain steps constitute pre-requisites for accessing others (i.e. 'you cannot go to learning object 2 before learning object 1'). Your sequence can be <i>suggestive</i> (simply displaying steps one after the other) or <i>prescriptive</i> (involving pre-requisites so that learners are required to follow steps in a particular order).</p><p><b>How do I create my own Learning Path (Course)?</b></p><p>Proceed to the 'Learning Path' section.  There you can create as many courses/paths as you wish by clicking the <i>Create a new course</i> tool. You will need to choose a name for the course/path (e.g. <i>Unit 1</i> if you plan to create several units within the overall course). To begin with, the course is empty, waiting for you to add sections and learning objects to it.<br>If you set a course to Visible, it will appear as a new tool on the course homepage. This makes it easier and clearer for students to access.</p><p><b>What learning objects can I add?</b></p><p>All Chamilo tools, activities and content that you consider useful and relevant to your course can be added :<br><ul><li>Separate documents (texts, pictures, Office docs, ...)</li><li>Forums as a whole</li><li>Topics</li><li>Links</li><li>Chamilo Tests</li><li>HotPotatoes Tests<br />(note :tests made invisible on the homepage, but included in a path, become visible for learners only as they work through the course.)</li><li>Assignments</li><li>External links</li></ul></p><p><b>Other features</b></p><p>Learners can be asked to follow your course in a given order, as you can set <u>pre-requisites</u>. This means for example that learners cannot go to e.g. Quiz 2 until they have read e.g. Document 1. All learning objects have a status:<i>completed</i> or <i>incomplete</i>, so the progress of learners is clearly reported.</p><p>If you alter the original title of a learning object, the new name will appear in the course, but the original title will not be deleted. So if you want test8.doc to appear as 'Final Exam' in the path, you do not have to rename the file, you can use the new title in the path. It is also useful to give new titles to links which are too long.</p><p>When you're finished, don't forget to check Display mode, (showing, as in learner view, the table of contents on the left and the learning objects on the right,one at a time.)</p><br><p><b>What is a SCORM course and how do I import one?</b></p><p>The learning path tool allows you to upload SCORM-compliant courses.</p><p>SCORM  (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) is a public standard followed by major e-Learning companies like NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft, etc. They act at three levels:</p><ul><li><b>Economy</b> : SCORM renders whole courses or small content units reusable on different Learning Management Systems (LMS) through the separation of content and context,</li><li><b>Pedagogy</b> : SCORM integrates the notion of pre-requisite or <i>sequencing</i> (<i>e.g. </i>\"You cannot go to chapter 2 before passing Quiz 1\"),</li><li><b>Technology</b> : SCORM generates a table of contents as an abstraction layer located outside the content and the LMS. It helps both communicate with each other. Mainly communicated are <i>bookmarks</i>(\"Where is John in the course?\"), <i>scoring</i> (\"How did John pass the test?\") and <i>time</i> (\"How much time did John spent in chapter 1?\").</li></ul><b>How can I create a SCORM-compliant Learning Path?</b><br><br>The obvious way is to use the Chamilo Authoring tool. However, you may prefer to create complete SCORM compliant websites locally on your own computer before uploading it onto your Chamilo platform. In this case, we recommend the use of a sophisticated tool such as Lectora®, eXe Learning® or Reload®<br></p><p>"
msgstr "Alat Put učenja ima dvije funkcije: <ul><li>Izrada puta učenja</li> <li>Učitavanje puta učenja formata Scorm ili IMS</li></ul> <img src=\"../img/path_help.gif\"> <p><b> Što je put učenja?</b></p> <p>Put učenja je niz nastavnih koraka uključenih u poglavlja. Može biti temeljen na sadržaju (i izgledati poput kazala) ili na aktivnostima, pa izgleda poput rasporeda ili programa aktivnosti koje morate učiniti kako biste razumjeli i izvježbali određeno znanje ili vještinu.</p> <p>Osim što je strukturiran, put učenja može biti i predstavljen u nizovima. To znači da će određeni koraci predstavljati preduvjet za druge korake ('ne možete prijeći na korak 2 prije no što dovršite korak 1'). Vaš niz može biti samo predložen (prikazujete korake jedan nakon drugoga) ili obvezujući (dodajete preduvjete tako da su rješavači prinuđeni slijediti niz). </p> <p><b>Kako izraditi vlastiti Put učenja?</b></p> <p> Prvi je korak doći do alata za izradu putova učenja. Na zaslonu Puta učenja postoji poveznica prema njemu. Ondje možete izraditi mnoge putove pritiskom na <i>Dodaj novi put učenja</i>. No oni su prazni dok im ne dodate poglavlja i korake.<br>Učinite li put vidljivim, pojavit će se kao novi alat na početnoj stranici kolegija. Tako je pristup njemu jednostavniji.</p> <p><b>Koji su koraci za ovaj put učenja? (Koji se elementi mogu dodati?)</b></p> <p>Svi alati, aktivnosti i sadržaji Chamiloa koje smatrate korisnima i povezanima s vašim imaginarnim putom mogu se dodati:<br><ul> <li>Elementi rasporeda</li> <li>Pojedinačni dokumenti (tekstovi, slike, Office dokumenti, ...)</li> <li>Obavijesti</li> <li>Forumi kao cjeline</li> <li>Teme</li> <li>Pojedinačne tematske poruke</li> <li>Poveznice</li> <li>Vježbe formata Chamilo</li> <li>Vježbe formata HotPotatoes <br>(opaska: nevidljive vježbe koje uključite u put studentima postaju vidljive, ali samo u alatu Put)</li> <li>Stranice s radovima</li> <li>Stranica Pretinca</li> <li>Vanjske poveznice, koje upućuju na stranice izvan sustava Chamilo</li></ul> </p> <p><b> Ostala svojstva Puta učenja</b> </p> <p> Možete zatražiti da studenti slijede (čitaju) vaš put prema zadanom redoslijedu jer u put možete postaviti <u>preduvjete</u>. To primjerice znači da studenti ne mogu rješavati Kviz 2 dok ne pročitaju Dokument 1. Svi elementi imaju status: dovršeni ili nedovršeni, pa je studentov napredak jasno označen. </p><p> Izmijenite li naslov koraka, novi će se naslov pojaviti na putu, ali stari neće biti izbrisan. Želite li, dakle, da se test8.doc pojavi kao 'Završni ispit' na putu, ne morate preimenovati datoteku već na putu možete koristiti novi naslov. Također je korisno poveznicama dati nove naslove jer su stari predugački. </p><p> Kad završite ne zaboravite provjeriti studentov pogled gdje se kazalo pojavljuje na lijevoj, a koraci puta obično na desnoj strani, jedan po jedan. </p><br><p><b> Što je put učenja formata Scorm ili IMS i kako ga prenijeti?</b> </p> <p>Alat puta učenja omogućuje vam da učitate sadržaje kolegija sukladne s formatima SCORM i IMS.</p> <p>SCORM (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) je javni standard koji slijede vodeći sudionici u elektroničkom učenju kao NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft, itd. i djeluje na tri razine: </p> <ul> <li><b>Ekonomija</b> : Scorm omogućuje da se cijeli kolegiji ili manje sadržajne jedinice ponovno koriste na raznim Sustavima upravljanja učenjem (Learning Management Systems - LMS) odvajanjem sadržaja od konteksta,</li> <li><b>Pedagogija</b> : Scorm uključuje pojam preduvjetovanja ili <i>nizanja</i> (<i>npr. </i>\"Ne možete prijeći na poglavlje 2 prije no što prođete Kviz 1\"),</li> <li><b>Tehnologija</b> : Scorm stvara kazalo kao apstraktni sloj smješten izvan sadržaja i LMS-a. Pomaže pri lakšoj međusobnoj komunikaciji sadržaja i LMS-a. Uglavnom se dojavljuju <i>bilješke</i>(\"Gdje je Janko u kolegiju?\"), <i>rezultati</i> (\"Kako je John riješio vježbu?\") i <i>vrijeme</i> (\"Koliko je vremena Janko proveo u poglavlju 1?\").</li> </ul> <b>Kako izraditi put učenja sukladan s formatom SCORM?</b><br> <br> Najprirodniji način jest da koristite alat za izradu puteva učenja Chamilo.

Can users register to it? You can use these settings dynamically e.g. allow self-registration for one week > ask your students to register > close access to self-registration > remove possible intruders through the Users list. This way you keep control of who is registered while avoiding the administrative hassle of registering them yourself.</p>(Note - some organizations prefer not to use this method and opt to centralise registration. In this case, participants cannot enrol in your course at all, even if you, as a trainer / teacher, wish to give them access. To check this, look at the home page of your campus (as opposed to your course homepage) to see if the 'Register' link is present.) </p> <p>At the bottom of the page, you can back up the course and delete it. Backup will create a file on the server and allow you to copy it on your own Hard Disk locally so that there will be two backups each in different places. If you back up a course and then delete it you will not be be able to restore it yourself, but the system administrator can do this for you if you give him/her the code of your course. Backing up a course is also a good way to get all your documents transferred to your own computer. You will need a tool, like Winzip® to UNZIP the archive.
