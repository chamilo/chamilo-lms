Here again, it is up to you to deactivate the ones you don't need. You just have to click on 'deactivate'. Then it goes down to the grey section of your homepage an becomes invisible to your students.  However, you can reactivate it whenever you want, making it visible to the students once more.</p><p>You can add your own pages to your Home Page. These pages must be HTML pages (which can be created by any Word Processor or Web Composer). Use 'Upload page and link to Homepage' to send your page to the server. The standard header of your website will be automatically merged with your new document, so that you just need to concentrate on the content. If you want to link from your Home towards existaing websites or pages existing anywhere on the web (even inside your own site), use 'Add link on Homepage' The pages you have added to the Home page can deactivated then deleted, where the standard tools can be deactivated, but not deleted.</p><p>Once your course website is ready, go to 'Modify course info' and decide what level of confidentiality you want.
