<h2><a name="1._Pre-requisites"></a>1. Pre-requisites</h2>

Chamilo
can be installed on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and UNIX servers
indifferently. However, we recommend the use of Linux server for
optimal flexibility, remote control and scalability. <br />

<br />

Chamilo is mainly a LMS running (the so called <span style="font-weight: bold;">AMP</span> trilogy): <br />
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Apache 2.2+</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">MySQL 5.6+ or MariaDB 5+</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">PHP 5.5+ (7.2 recommended for greater efficiency)</span></li>
</ul>
<br />
All these pieces of software are free software and freely available. <br /><br />
To run Chamilo <span style="font-weight: bold;">LMS</span> on your server, you need to install WAMP, LAMP or MAMP:
<ul>
  <li>To install <span style="font-weight: bold;">WAMP</span> (AMP on Windows), we recommend the <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a> .exe installer<a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html"></a></li>
  <li>To install <span style="font-weight: bold;">LAMP</span>
(AMP on Linux), use the Package manager of your favourite distribution (Synaptic, RPMFinder etc.).
For instance, on a Ubuntu server,&nbsp;use Shell or Synaptic following the
    <a href="http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty#Apache_HTTP_Server">Ubuntuguide on Apache</a> and the following sections
  </li>
  <li>To install <span style="font-weight: bold;">MAMP</span> (AMP on Mac OS X), refer to the <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php">MAMP</a> dedicated website<a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php"></a></li>
  <li>Make sure you check the <a href="dependencies.html" title="Dependencies">Dependencies page</a> if you need to know the requirements in more precise way.
</ul>
<br />

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">MySQL or MariaDB database server</span></h3>
    You will need a login and password allowing you to manage <em>and drop+create</em> a database. Usually, the default configuration on local computers is
to allow you to connect as root with an empty password. It is <b>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</b> to change the password and define a user with access to
only a specific database. Please refer to the MySQL or MariaDB documentation in order to do this.<br />
<br />
<span class="text-muted">Chamilo versions prior to 1.9.0 required to choose between multiple databases and a deprecated single-database mode.
    This has been cleaned up and simplified to one single database.</span><br />
<span class="text-muted">If you don't have create permissions for your database user, Chamilo will fail during
    installation because, to maintain the database clear of any remains of other systems, it will try to drop it
    before creating it again. This is explained in some detail in <a href="https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/issues/2172">this issue report</a></span><br />

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Apache's redirects</span></h3>
    Since version 1.10, Chamilo requires the web server to be able to deal with redirects. This is now very common within web platforms (be them CMS, LMS, ERP, etc) and allows them, between other things, to use URLs in an efficient and user-friendly manner.<br />
        If you don't use Apache as a web server, go to section "Rewrite configurations" at the end of this document.<br />
        If you do use Apache, configuring redirects is done in two small steps:
    <ul>
        <li>Enable the "rewrite" module in Apache (on the command line, run "<i>sudo a2enmod rewrite</i>")</li>
        <li>Configure the Apache's VirtualHost for your Chamilo to include the following block, which will allow .htaccess files within Chamilo to be interpreted</li>
    </ul>
    For Apache <=2.2 (where /var/www/chamilo should be replaced by the path to your Chamilo install):
    <pre>
    &lt;Directory /&gt;
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
    &lt;Directory /var/www/chamilo/&gt;
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
    </pre>
    and for Apache >=2.4:
    <pre>
    &lt;Directory /&gt;
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
    &lt;Directory /var/www/chamilo/&gt;
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
    </pre>
    <br />
    Once configured (and maybe this has already been done by your hosting provider), you can simply restart the web server to enable the change.

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" />
<h2><a name="2._Installation_of_Chamilo_LMS"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Installation of Chamilo LMS</span></h2>
<p>
Before you start installing Chamilo LMS, you must understand that, because we provide Chamilo as free software, many services providers
    have been able to develop extensions of Chamilo, which have made it possible to install Chamilo in many ways:<br />
<ul>
    <li>As an all-in-one package through an official provider, certified by the Chamilo Association</li>
    <li>As an installable solution from one of many hosting providers who support cPanel with Scriptaculous</li>
    <li>At your preferred hosting provider using remote installers like Installatron</li>
    <li>Through a Docker container image</li>
    <li>On your own server, downloading and installing manually</li>
    <li>On your own computer, at home or at the office, just for testing or development</li>
</ul>
This guide only covers these 2 last methods. For other methods, you can always ask more information from the provider you will choose.
<br /><br />
    To install, follow these 6 simple steps:
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://chamilo.org/chamilo-lms/">Download Chamilo LMS</a></li>
  <li>Unzip it</li>
  <li>Copy the Chamilo directory in your web server's root directory. This can be
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">C:\xampp\htdocs\</span> on a Windows server or <span style="font-weight: bold;">/var/www/html/chamilo</span> (or /var/www/chamilo/) on a Linux server (You need to create the folder "chamilo")</li>
  <li>Verify your web server supports .htaccess files (see Rewrite section below)</li>
  <li>Open your web browser and type
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">http://localhost/chamilo/</span> if you install locally for test purposes or
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">http://www.your-chamilo-domain.com</span> if you install remotely*
    </li>
  <li>Follow the web installation process. You can accept all default values. Consider changing the admin password to remember it.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We recommend defining a specific Virtual Host for this installation.</li>
    <li>If you have to install multiple Chamilo instances, avoid the installation of Chamilo in a inside a folder, instead prefer the use of different domains or using subdomains examples:
        <ol>
            <li>http://www.my-domain.com/ (<i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> recommended)</li>
            <li>http://chamilo.my-domain.com (<i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> recommended)</li>
            <li>http://chamilo2.my-domain.com (<i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> recommended)</li>
            <li>http://www.my-domain.com/chamilo (<i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true"></i> not recommended)</li>
            <li>http://www.my-domain.com/chamilo2 (<i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true"></i> not recommended)</li>
            <li>http://chamilo.my-domain.com/my-chamilo/ (<i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true"></i> not recommended)</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<br />
<span class="text-muted">
    Note: if installing Chamilo locally using localhost or the IP address of your computer during the installation, you might get issues
    while accessing from another computer. To avoid this, you can
    <a href="https://beeznest.com/blog/2013/01/15/answering-to-different-addresses-with-chamilo/">apply a little change to your configuration file</a>.
</span>


<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p>The following directories need to be <b>readable, writeable and executable</b> by your web server.
This usually requires no specific action on Windows servers, but will require a "chmod" under Linux and Mac. See instructions below.</p>
    Replace [chamilo] with the directory where your Chamilo installation is located):
<ul>
    <li>[chamilo]/app/</li>
    <li>[chamilo]/vendor/ (only needs to be readable and executable)</li>
    <li>[chamilo]/web/</li>
    <li>[chamilo]/main/default_course_document/images/</li>
</ul>
Optionally, you can do the same to the following directory if you want to
enable sub-languages definition:
<ul>
  <li>[chamilo]/main/lang/</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you find a tests/ directory at the root of your package, please delete it.
This is a development directory that has not been checked for security issues,
an it should *never* be accessible to final users on a production server.
</p>
<p><span class="text-muted">On Linux, Mac OS X and BSD operating systems you can use the <em>chmod 0775</em> command for this (although we recommend you seek advice from an
experienced system administrator to avoid security issues). On Windows, you may need to check the properties of the folders (by right-clicking on them).</span></p>


<h3>Post-installation security checklist</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Protect your configuration folder: </strong>
make sure no one (but you) can overwrite it. You can find the config directory in
<em>(chamilo folder)</em>/app/config.
Make it read-only (windows/xwindows: right-click the file to edit the
properties. linux/bsd/macosx: use the chmod 0555 command). The config
file is created by your web server (Apache + PHP, usually) so you may
need to be root user to change its permissions.</li>
  <li><strong>Configure your Chamilo portal: </strong>
in the administration section of Chamilo, you can use the Chamilo Configuration
Settings to adjust the behavior of your installation.</li>
  <li>For stronger security tips, please check our new <a href="./security.html">security guide</a> for more</li>
</ul>

<br />


<h3>PHP configuration</h3>


To get the best out of Chamilo, you need to finetune your PHP settings. Consider : <br />

<ul>
    <li>Configuring Chamilo mail: Most of Chamilo uses the mail settings from the php.ini file. However,
        if you use a distinct e-mail server, you might need to adjust the
        e-mail setting in <em>(chamilo folder)</em>/app/config/mail.conf.php.</li>

  <li>Editing php.ini file (on Windows can usually be located at
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">C:\xampp\php\php.ini</span>,
  on Ubuntu Linux :
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini</span></li>
  <li>search the word "_max" and increase the following values to optimise the server</li>
</ul>

<pre>
    max_execution_time = 300; Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
    max_input_time = 600; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data
    memory_limit = 256M; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (128MB)
    post_max_size = 100M
    upload_max_filesize = 100M;
    short_open_tag       = Off
    safe_mode            = Off
    magic_quotes_gpc     = Off
    magic_quotes_runtime = Off</pre>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> You need to set
your <em>date.timezone</em> setting to whatever your server's timezone is. For example, if your server is in the 'America/New_York' timezone,
    set the date.timezone parameter to this value in your php.ini:</p>

<pre>
date.timezone = 'America/New_York'
</pre>
<br />
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <span class="text-muted">PHP 5.3.9 introduces a new setting "max_input_vars", which limits the number of elements you can send in one single form. If you are dealing with numerous users or very long learning paths (many items), make sure you set this setting higher than its default value of 1000.</span></p>

<p><strong>BSD and CentOS users:</strong> these php libraries have to be included during the PHP installation (php5 might have to be replaced by php in some instances):</p>

<ul>
    <li>php5-session: The session shared extension for php</li>
    <li>php5-mysqlnd (or php5-mysqli): The mysql shared extension for php</li>
    <li>php5-zlib: The zlib shared extension for php</li>
    <li>php5-pcre: The pcre shared extension for php</li>
    <li>php5-xml</li>
    <li>php5-json</li>
    <li>php5-mcrypt</li>
    <li>php5-iconv or php5-mbstring (either one of them)</li>
    <li>php5-gd The graphics-generation extension for PHP</li>
    <li>php5-intl The international behaviours extension for PHP</li>
</ul>

<p>You might also add the following php modules and packages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>php5-ctype</li>
    <li>php5-ldap</li>
    <li>php5-xapian</li>
    <li>php5-curl</li>
    <li>php5-xsl</li>
</ul>


<hr />
<h2><a name="3._Upgrade"></a>3. Upgrade</h2>

Before upgrading, we <b>heavily</b> recommend you do a full backup of the previous
Chamilo directories and databases. If you are unsure how to achieve this
please ask your hosting provider for advice <b>before</b> you continue further.<br /><br />

<div class="text-muted"> NOTE: For very heavy Chamilo databases, some of our official
providers have developed improved migration procedures that use more memory but
process the upgrades much faster. If this is the kind of thing you
need, we highly recommend you contact them (see reference below).</div>
<br />
<div class="text-muted"> NOTE: This version of Chamilo can only be used to upgrade
from earlier versions of Chamilo 1.9.*. You cannot use the normal
upgrade scripts from Chamilo 1.11 to upgrade from Chamilo 1.8.* or even Dok€os 2.0
(which was born after the split with Chamilo). If you need this, please contact one
of the Chamilo Association's <a href="https://chamilo.org/providers">official providers</a>)</div>
<p></p>

<h3>3.1 Upgrading from Chamilo 1.11.x (Minor version)</h3>
As this is only a minor version change from previous 1.11.* versions of Chamilo, the only thing you need to do is:
<ul>
  <li> check that you haven't left any customised stylesheet or image <span class="text-muted">(if you have, make sure you keep a copy on the side*)</span></li>
  <li> download the Chamilo 1.11 install package from the <a href="http://www.chamilo.org/download">Chamilo download page</a></li>
  <li> unzip the new files of Chamilo 1.11 over the files of the older version
    (or unzip the files in one folder and then copy the files from there to the
    older version's directory).</li>
  <li> clean your app/cache/twig directory: delete all the contents *in* this directory (do NOT remove the directory itself, only its contents!).
       It will all be re-generated.
      You can also delete the contents of this directory through the "Archive directory cleanup" option in the "System" box of the Administration page.</li>
  <li> you're done! No other upgrade procedure is required</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.2 Upgrading from Chamilo 1.10.x</h3>
<ul>
  <li> check that you haven't left any customised stylesheet or image <span class="text-muted">(if you have, make sure you keep a copy on the side*)</span></li>
  <li> download the Chamilo 1.11 install package from the <a href="http://www.chamilo.org/download">Chamilo download page</a></li>
  <li> unzip the new files of Chamilo 1.11 over the files of the older version
    (or unzip the files in one folder and then copy the files from there to the
    older version's directory). Note that you should remove the "home" and
    "searchdb" directories from the package before you overwrite the previous
    files.</li>
  <li> clean your app/cache/twig directory: delete all the contents *in* this directory (do NOT remove the directory itself, only its contents!). It will all be re-generated. You can also delete the contents of this directory through the "Archive directory cleanup" option in the "System" box of the Administration page.</li>
  <li>Go to your portal install page (main/install/) and follow the upgrade procedure</li>
</ul>
Please note that if you (unluckily) upgraded from any of the 1.9 versions to 1.10.0 against our recommendations, we
    provide a patch script that should get most of it in order. The script is available here:<br />
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/1.10.x/tests/scripts/fix_migrations_1.9.x_1.10.0.php">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/1.10.x/tests/scripts/fix_migrations_1.9.x_1.10.0.php</a> or, if
    you are using a development version of Chamilo, directly into you tests/scripts/ folder. You should place the file
    in the /tests/scripts/ folder, then edit it to remove the "die();" line, then launch it from your browser (after
    connecting to your Chamilo site as admin). You should also remove the scripts afterwards.<br />
    This script is provided without warranty. Please *always* take a backup before you use it.
<br />

<h3>3.3 Upgrading from Chamilo 1.9.x</h3>

<p>Chamilo LMS 1.11.x comes with a new database structure in comparison to 1.9,
as was the case between 1.9 and 1.8.
Although the upgrade script takes the migration in charge, it might be generating
a very heavy load on your server during the upgrade, and will change your
database considerably, preserving the data as well as possible (we have tested
the procedure many times, but remember this is GNU/GPLv3 and we cannot be held
responsible for what would happen to your data without professional supervision).
This is why we *really* recommend you take a full backup of your system before
you upgrade.</p>

Also note that Chamilo LMS 1.10 unites all language files from the
main/lang/ directory into one single file by language.
If you have changed language files directly (instead of
using the recommended way: sub-languages), you should take a backup copy of
these changed translations before you upgrade. Sublanguages might also require
some manual work, but the upgrade procedure will not touch sublanguages directly.
<br /><br />

<ul>
  <li> make sure you don't have tables from previous versions of Chamilo still hanging around. These can cause the upgrade to fail. In particular, tables from versions 1.8.* could have multiple tables for each course, resulting in many tables with the same prefix. Only tables without prefix or with a "c_" prefix exist in 1.9 and superior versions. Make sure none of these tables persist. Take a backup of your database (just in case) and delete these prefixed tables (drop table ...).</li>
  <li> check that you haven't left any customised stylesheet or image <span class="text-muted">(if you have, make sure you keep a copy on the side*)</span></li>
  <li> download the Chamilo 1.11 install package from the <a href="http://www.chamilo.org/download">Chamilo download page</a></li>
  <li> unzip the new files of Chamilo 1.11 over the files of the older version (or unzip the files in one folder and then copy the files from there to the older version's directory)</li>
  <li> make *absolutely sure* that the .htaccess file of version 1.11 is copied as well</li>
  <li> make sure "AllowOverride All" is present in your Apache configuration, as interpreting the .htaccess files is very important for Chamilo to work (note that the Order-Allow directive has been replaced by "Require all granted" in Apache 2.4)</li>
  <li> point your browser on your portal URL + main/install/</li>
  <li> click&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Install</span>, then choose <span style="font-style: italic;">Upgrade from 1.9.*</span></li>
  <li> once your portal is upgraded, clean your app/cache/twig directory: delete all the contents *in* this directory (do NOT remove the directory itself, only its contents!). It will all be re-generated. You can also delete the contents of this directory through the "Archive directory cleanup" option in the "System" box of the Administration page.</li>
</ul>

<br />

<span class="text-muted">* Styles and images are located in the main/css or main/img
directories. You can still recover them from your backup if you have made it.
 Any modified style or image that uses the default style/image name will be
 overwritten by the next step. To avoid loosing your customisations, always
 ensure you copy the styles/images under a new name and use and modify the
 copy, not the original. The original will always be overwritten by newer
 versions. In Dok€os 1.8.5, we have changed the name of several CSS themes.
 Backwards compatibility is ensured by the fact that an upgrade only adds the
new themes, but you should try and use these new themes rather than sticking
to the old ones which will be deprecated shortly (not maintained).</span>
<br />

<p></p>

<p>
<b>WARNING:</b><br />

Do not delete the previous Chamilo installation directory before installing
the new one. The upgrade process should take care of all unrequired folders.</p>

<h3>3.4 Upgrading from Chamilo 1.8.x</h3>
To upgrade from version of Chamilo prior to 1.9.0, you will need to first upgrade them to 1.9.10.x, then upgrade again (separately) to 1.11.x.
You can find the 1.9.10.x packages here: <a href="https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/releases">https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/releases</a>

<p></p>
<h3>3.5 Directories permissions when upgrading from 1.9.x</h3>

The following directories need to be readable, writeable and executable for the web server:
<ul>
    <li>[chamilo]/main/lang/ (in order to delete unnecessary language files)</li>
    <li>[chamilo]/courses/ (in order to move the courses files to the app/courses folder)</li>
    <li>[chamilo]/archive/ (in order to remove unnecessary files or move them to app/cache/)</li>
    <li>[chamilo]/home/ (in order to move files to app/home)</li>
    <li>[chamilo]/app</li>
    <li>[chamilo]/web</li>
    <li>[chamilo]/vendor</li>

<h2><a name="6._LDAP"></a>6. LDAP</h2>

<p>
<i>This part is optional, only organisations with an LDAP server will need to read this.</i><br />
An LDAP module is already provided in Chamilo, but it has to be configured to make it work.</p>


<h3><b>Compiling</b></h3>

<p>
Linux servers: It's possible that you have to recompile php with ldap support.
Newer distributions also allow downloading rpms for additional packages.</p>


<h3><b>Activating LDAP in Chamilo</b></h3>

<p class="text-muted">Note: Please check
the LDAP configuration settings inside Chamilo to learn the details.</p>


In [Chamilo folder]/app/config/configuration.php, around line 93, you'll find settings like the following: <br />
<pre>
// -> Uncomment the two lines below to activate LDAP AND edit main/inc/conf/auth.conf.php for configuration
// $extAuthSource["extldap"]["login"] = $_configuration['root_sys'].$_configuration['code_append']."auth/external_login/login.ldap.php";
// $extAuthSource["extldap"]["newUser"] = $_configuration['root_sys'].$_configuration['code_append']."auth/external_login/newUser.ldap.php";
</pre>

remove the // from the last two lines to activate LDAP.<br />



<h3><b>Settings</b></h3>

<p>
Ask the LDAP server admin for the settings:</p>

<ul>

  <li>ldap server name</li>

  <li>ldap server port (usually 389)</li>

  <li>ldap dc</li>
</ul>
Since 1.8.5, you have to change the LDAP settings inside the "Portal
administration" panel, under "Chamilo configuration settings", section
"LDAP".
<br />

As an example, you should find the following kind of values:<br />

LDAP main server's address: "myldapserver.com";  // your ldap server<br />

LDAP main server's port: 389;                 // your ldap server's port number<br />

LDAP domain: "dc=xx, dc=yy, dc=zz"; //domain<br />

<br />


<h3><b>Teacher/student status</b></h3>

<p>
By default, Chamilo will check if the "employeenumber" field has a value. If it has, then Chamilo will
consider this user as being a teacher.<br />

If you want to change this behaviour, you can edit main/auth/ldap/authldap.php, function ldap_put_user_info_locally(),
and change the <em>if (empty($info_array[$tutor_field]))</em> condition to whatever suits you.<br />

You can also remove this check by removing the condition and leaving only the <em>$status = STUDENT;</em> line.</p>


<h3><b>Protected LDAP servers</b></h3>


<p>
Some LDAP servers do not support anonymous use of the directory services.<br />
In this case, you should fill in the appropriate fields in the
administration panel (e.g. "manager" and "mypassword") and Chamilo will
try to authenticate using these, or fall back to anonymous mode before
giving up.</p>


<h3>LDAP import into sessions</h3>

<p>There is a new set of scripts now that allow you to insert users
from LDAP directly into a Chamilo session. This, however, relies on a
set of static choices in the LDAP contact attributes.<br />

The fields used intensively by the Chamlio module are:<br />
</p>

<ul>

    <li>uid, which is matched to the username in Chamilo</li>

    <li>userPassword, which is matched to the user password, although
this part will only work for non-encrypted passwords for now, but it
shouldn't be necessary if using the LDAP server as authentication</li>

    <li>ou should end with the year of the person registration or any
criteria you will use to filter users, so that they can be retrieved on
that criteria</li>

    <li>sn is used as the lastname field in Chamilo</li>

    <li>givenName is used as the firstname field in Chamilo</li>

    <li>mail is used as the email field in Chamilo</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="9._WIRIS_mathematical_formulas"></a>7. Mathematical formulas with WIRIS</h2>
<p>Installing this plugin you get WIRIS editor and WIRIS CAS. <br/>
This activation will not be completed unless you have previously downloaded the <a href="http://www.wiris.com/plugins/ckeditor/download" target="_blank">PHP plugin for CKeditor WIRIS</a> and unzipped its contents into the main/inc/lib/ckeditor/editor/plugins/ckeditor_wiris/ directory. <br/>This is necessary because Wiris is proprietary software and its services are <a href="http://www.wiris.com/store/who-pays" target="_blank">commercial</a>. To make adjustments to the plugin, edit configuration.ini file or replace his content by configuration.ini.default Chamilo file.</p>

<h2><a name="10._Xapian_fulltext_indexing"></a>8. Full-text indexation with Xapian</h2>
<p>
<em>Note</em>: This step will require a dedicated server or a virtual dedicated server as the packages involved are not available on most shared hosting solutions.<br />
On Debian or Ubuntu 10.04 and superior, you will simply need to install the php5-xapian package and restart your web server:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install php5-xapian
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
</pre>
<p>
Then go to your administration page -&gt; Configuration settings -&gt; Search
and enable the search tool. Follow the recommendations on the page to get the
complete indexing suite installed. Once you're done, all documents you import
into your Chamilo portal in a recognized format will be indexed and searchable.
Chamilo intermediate Administrators training (which you can ask any <a href="http://www.chamilo.org/en/providers">Chamilo's Official Provider</a> for) include a full review of the full-text search feature.</p>
<p class="text-muted">
Note: Xapian's licensing for the PHP extension is a bit different than what is necessary to enter the Debian repositories, so it has been excluded. You can, however, generate your own package by following the <a href="http://trac.xapian.org/wiki/FAQ/PHP%20Bindings%20Package">packaging instructions on Xapian's wiki</a>.
</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" />
<h2><a name="11._Chamilo_rapid_ppt_conversion"></a>9. Chamilo Rapid - PPT conversion system</h2>
<p>
<em>Note</em>: This step will require a dedicated server or a virtual dedicated server as the packages involved are not available on most shared hosting solutions.<br />
On Debian or Ubuntu 11.10 and superior, install LibreOffice v3 (or v4) and start it as a headless server:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install libreoffice screen
sudo adduser rapid
sudo adduser rapid www-data
screen
sudo -s
su - rapid
soffice --accept="socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=2002,tcpNoDelay=1;urp;" --headless --nodefault --nofirststartwizard --nolockcheck --nologo --norestore
CTRL+a, CTRL+d
</pre>
Please note that this will effectively launch LibreOffice in a "headless" mode (thanks to the --headless option), in a "headless" terminal (thanks to screen). You can later get back into your "headless" terminal by launching:
<pre>
sudo screen -r
</pre>
You can then go to your administration page -&gt; <i>Chamilo Rapid</i> and set the host to "localhost" and the port to "2002". Save. Go to your course, learning path tool and see the new icon appeared. Import your PPT. This should work.
<em>Note</em>: Sometimes, this doesn't work out so easily. You can probably ask for the assistance of any system administrator around with a bit of Java and PHP experience, or you can always ask one of the Chamilo's Official Providers for assistance (ask for a guaranteed commercial contract). The above is *not* meant for production servers with a high load. You should get a real system administrator to look at it and develop init scripts, in a way that makes monitoring and relaunching feasable. If any sysadmin wants to contribute this, feel free to contribute it to Chamilo: send us an e-mail at info@chamilo.org.
<em>Note</em>: If you use LibreOffice 4, please note that version 4.2 (available in Ubuntu 14.04) has demonstrated to be more successfull at converting documents than version 4.1, which tended to crash when sending a document for conversion.

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" />
<h2><a name="12._Setting_cron_up"></a>10. Setting chronological tasks</h2>
<p>
Since Chamilo 1.8.8, a few tasks need to be executed regularly in order to get
the best out of your server resources. One of such tasks (and the only one
around at the time of Chamilo 1.8.8) is the sending of internal messaging
notifications by e-mail, i.e. when you receive an e-mail from another person or
from a group inside the internal messaging system of Chamilo, if all e-mails are
sent immediately, then you might not have the chance to receive them at your
pace, once a day or even once a week. For cases like this you, as a Chamilo
administrator, should setup a cron process on the server to check the queue of
e-mails and send is timely.</p>

Setting up a cron task is easy and there are several ways to do it. We recommend
you have a look at the <a href="http://drupal.org/cron">Drupal documentation
for setting up cron</a> and define your own cron process as:
<pre>
35 * * * * wget -O - -q -t 1 http://campus.example.com/main/cron/run.php
</pre>
Make sure you have a look into run.php as maybe you want to change a few
settings there.


<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" />
<h2><a name="13._Changing_language_names_order"></a>11. Changing the language's firstname/lastname order</h2>
As Chamilo becomes more popular and crosses many borders now, it frequently happens that administrators want to re-order the firstname and lastname fields in tables, and also on which field it is sorted first.<br/><br />
This can easily be modified by editing the app/config/configuration.php file, finding the following section, uncommenting the PHP lines and adapting it to your language:<br />
<pre>// Custom name_order_conventions
//$_configuration['name_order_conventions'] = array(
// 'french' => array('format' => 'title last_name first_name', 'sort_by' => 'last_name')
//);</pre><br />
Feel free to change this to<br />
<pre>// Custom name_order_conventions
$_configuration['name_order_conventions'] = array(
  'french' => array('format' => 'first_name last_name', 'sort_by' => 'last_name')
);
</pre>
<br />
for example. The effect should be immediate.
<br />
Please note that, although Chamilo allows you to define its position, the "title" field does not exist at this time, so no need to worry about it.

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" />
<h2><a name="14._Improving_files_download"></a>12. Improving files download efficiency</h2>
File download can be very slow when passing through a PHP script to control permissions. One solution to this
    is to use the X-Sendfile header, which depends on a module on the webserver. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3731639/1406662">Check http://stackoverflow.com/a/3731639/1406662 for more details on implementing Sendfile</a>.
Chamilo LMS 1.9.8 (and following versions) supports the X-Sendfile headers, but requires a specific line of configuration to be
    added to configuration.php:
<pre>
$_configuration['enable_x_sendfile_headers'] = true;
</pre>
If you have issues with files taking a long time to download, make sure you reconfigure your webserver and add this line. You should see an notable difference in download time.
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" />
<h2><a name="15._Videoconference"></a>13. Videoconference</h2>
<p>
  Chamilo supports the connection to two different videoconference servers: BigBlueButton (versions 0.81, 0.9 and 1.0) and OpenMeetings.<br />
  While BigBlueButton seem easier to install, more clearly documented and more
  esthetically finished, some users have manifested that OpenMeetings
  consumes less bandwidth, is less restrictive in terms of running environments
  and offers more tools and connectors.<br />
  The decision is up to you, but in any case you will have to install a
  videoconference server separately from the normal Chamilo LMS installation
  process.<br />
  You will find the <a href="http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/install/install.html">installation guide for BigBlueButton here</a>. Once installed,
  issue a "bbb-conf --secret" on the command line to get the parameters to
  indicate in the "Videoconference" plugin in Chamilo (platform settings page).<br />
  This should make an additional "Videoconference" tool icon appear in every course.<br />
</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" />
    <h2><a name="16._Rewrite"></a>14. Rewrite</h2>
    <p>
    Chamilo LMS 1.10 is the first version to require the web server to allow redirections of requests (and so 1.11 does as well).<br />
    For Apache, this is done through enabling the Rewrite module and either allowing overrides (through .htaccess) or adding a specific configuration section to the VirtualHost defined for Apache.<br />
    For Nginx, this is done through specific redirection rules in the corresponding virtual host (server clause).<br /><br />
    To make sure this isn't too complex for anyone, we recommend a configuration below to help you out in both cases.
        Please note that using .htaccess is the easiest way but might affect your server load considerably,
        given .htaccess files are interpreted on *every* request, while a configuration block in your VirtualHost
        section is compiled at configuration reload time.
    <h3>Apache + .htaccess</h3>
        To enable .htaccess on Apache, you just need to check 1 thing: In a &lt;Directory&gt; block of the root folder of Chamilo, ensure the following lines are present:
        <pre>
    &lt;Directory /&gt;
        AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		allow from all
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
    </pre>
    or, if you are working with Apache 2.4, that syntax changed a little and looks more like this:
    <pre>
    &lt;Directory /&gt;
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
    </pre>
    <h3>Apache RewriteRules</h3>
    <pre>
  &lt;LocationMatch "/.git*"&gt;
	order deny,allow
	deny from all
  &lt;/LocationMatch&gt;

  &lt;Directory ~/.&gt;
    AllowOverride None
	Options -Indexes
  &lt;/Directory&gt;

    Nginx doesn't support .htaccess rules, so you have no other option than to apply the following rules (note that your PHP backend configuration may vary).

    <h3>Apple on OS X servers</h3>
    <div>
        Scott Steven reports that Apache on OS X requires specific actions<br />
        <ul>
            <li>First, make sure you have the .htaccess file present at the root of your Chamilo folder</li>
            <li>Get to your Apache"s HTTPd.conf file and configure your domain and the fact that mod_rewrite is loaded</li>
            <li>In your Apple Server app, Advanced Settings, check the box to allow .htaccess</li>
        </ul>
        Alternatively, you can find the settings file for your domain in Apple's settings folder under
        /Library/Server/Web/Settings to update it manually.<br />
        You cannot, however, only allow .htaccess files in the main httpd.conf file, as OS X will override it with the
        domain-specific configuration file.
    </div>

    <h2><a name="17._Git_Upgrade"></a>15. Upgrading from Git</h2>
    If you have sufficient experience with Git and have installed your initial Chamilo portal
        from the Git version, you might want to upgrade from 1.9.x to 1.11.x using Git directly.<br />
    Here are a few tips that might help you:<br />
    <ul>
    <li>Get into your Chamilo Git repository</li>
    <li>Make sure you have no additional elements that were not commited (git status/git stash)</li>
    <li>If you have issues, you can always save your code somewhere else and ask Git to put you exactly at the most recent 1.9.x stage ("git pull"/"git reset --hard origin/1.9.x")</li>
    <li>Once you're sure you have a "clean" local Chamilo repository, create a 1.11.x branch with "git checkout -b 1.11.x"</li>
    <li>In the new branch, download all code from the 1.11.x branch upstream: "git pull origin 1.11.x"</li>
    <li>If you never used composer or used it only a few times in the past, you might need to update it (rm -rf ~/.composer/vendor; composer clear-cache) before trying the following command</li>
    <li>Update composer: "composer update" (you might need to give a Github token here)</li>
    <li>Change permissions on folders app, web, main/lang and main/default_course_document/images</li>
    <li>Go to your portal install page (main/install/) and follow the upgrade procedure</li>
</ul>
