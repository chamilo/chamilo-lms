            Status:         Final
            Description:    This is the Common Cartridge v1.3 Profile of the IMS Global Metadata v1.3 binding of the IEEE LOMv1.0.
                            This is for the metadata associated with the manifest in a Common Cartridge. 
                            This is based upon a combination of the Strict/Loose binding of LOMv1.0.

            History:        Version 1.3: The third formal release of this CCv1.3 LOM for Manifest profile. The key change is that all 
                            features of the LOM are now available for use.

            PROFILE:        This is the "CCv1p3-Manifest". THIS IS A PROFILE OF THE BASE SPECIFICATION.

            Schematron Strict Selection Validation Rules
            ============================================
            This is the set of Schematron rules that have been created to enforce the use of the "Unordered" stereotype.
            These rules ensure that the number of entries in an unordered complexType of an element obey the multiplicity constraints.
            This is required so that any-order/any-multiplicity complexTypes can be constructed and validated.
