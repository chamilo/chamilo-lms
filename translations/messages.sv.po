In contrast to e-mail, a forum is for public, or semi-public, group discussion. </p>To use the Chamilo forum, members can simply use their browser - they do not require any distinct client software. </p>To organize forums, click on the Forums tool. Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>"

The change of this option will not affect the directories structure on disk, but will affect the behaviour of the Chamilo code, so if you change this option, you have to create the new directories and move the existing directories by yourself on te server. Be aware that when creating and moving those directories, you will have to move the directories of users 1 to 9 into subdirectories of the same name. If you are not sure about this option, it is best not to activate it."

msgid "What is OpenID?"
msgstr "Vad är OpenID?"

msgid "OpenID eliminates the need for multiple logins across different websites, simplifying your online experience. You get to choose the OpenID Provider that best meets your needs and most importantly that you trust. At the same time, your OpenID can stay with you, no matter which Provider you move to. And best of all, the OpenID technology is not proprietary and is completely free.For businesses, this means a lower cost of password and account management, while drawing new web traffic. OpenID lowers user frustration by letting users have control of their login.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://openid.net/what/\">Read on...</a>"
msgstr "OpenID minskar behovet av olika användarnamn på olika webbplatser. Du kan själv välja en OpenID-utgivare som du litar på och kan flytta med dig samma login till andra webbplatser. OpenID är inte bundet till någon speciell leverantör, det är en öppet och fri teknik. För företag och organisationer kan det bl a minska kostnaderna för kontohantering. För användaren ökar den egna kontrollen.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://openid.net/what/\">Läs mer...</a>"

Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and is not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>"

You can, for instance, first ask users to self-register.Then if you find some of them didn't register, decide to fill groups automatically (random) in order to complete them. You can also edit each group to determine membership, user by user, after or before self-registration and/or automatically on registration.</p><p>Filling groups, whether automatically or manually, is possible only for users registered on the course.

msgid "The Course tool supports two approaches :<ul><li>Create a new course (allowing you to author your own content)</li><li>Import SCORM course</li></ul><img src=\"../img/path_help.gif\"><p><b>What is a Learning Path?</b></p><p>A Learning Path allows for the presentation of a sequence of learning experiences or activities arranged in distinct sections (in this sense, the Learning Path is what distinguishes a 'course' from a mere repository of random documents). It can be content-based (serving as a table of contents) or activities-based, serving as an agenda or program of action necessary to understand and apply a particular area of knowledge or skill.</p><p>In addition to being  structured, a Learning Path can also be <i>sequential</i>, meaning that the completion of certain steps constitute pre-requisites for accessing others (i.e. 'you cannot go to learning object 2 before learning object 1'). Your sequence can be <i>suggestive</i> (simply displaying steps one after the other) or <i>prescriptive</i> (involving pre-requisites so that learners are required to follow steps in a particular order).</p><p><b>How do I create my own Learning Path (Course)?</b></p><p>Proceed to the 'Learning Path' section.  There you can create as many courses/paths as you wish by clicking the <i>Create a new course</i> tool. You will need to choose a name for the course/path (e.g. <i>Unit 1</i> if you plan to create several units within the overall course). To begin with, the course is empty, waiting for you to add sections and learning objects to it.<br>If you set a course to Visible, it will appear as a new tool on the course homepage. This makes it easier and clearer for students to access.</p><p><b>What learning objects can I add?</b></p><p>All Chamilo tools, activities and content that you consider useful and relevant to your course can be added :<br><ul><li>Separate documents (texts, pictures, Office docs, ...)</li><li>Forums as a whole</li><li>Topics</li><li>Links</li><li>Chamilo Tests</li><li>HotPotatoes Tests<br />(note :tests made invisible on the homepage, but included in a path, become visible for learners only as they work through the course.)</li><li>Assignments</li><li>External links</li></ul></p><p><b>Other features</b></p><p>Learners can be asked to follow your course in a given order, as you can set <u>pre-requisites</u>. This means for example that learners cannot go to e.g. Quiz 2 until they have read e.g. Document 1. All learning objects have a status:<i>completed</i> or <i>incomplete</i>, so the progress of learners is clearly reported.</p><p>If you alter the original title of a learning object, the new name will appear in the course, but the original title will not be deleted. So if you want test8.doc to appear as 'Final Exam' in the path, you do not have to rename the file, you can use the new title in the path. It is also useful to give new titles to links which are too long.</p><p>When you're finished, don't forget to check Display mode, (showing, as in learner view, the table of contents on the left and the learning objects on the right,one at a time.)</p><br><p><b>What is a SCORM course and how do I import one?</b></p><p>The learning path tool allows you to upload SCORM-compliant courses.</p><p>SCORM  (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) is a public standard followed by major e-Learning companies like NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft, etc. They act at three levels:</p><ul><li><b>Economy</b> : SCORM renders whole courses or small content units reusable on different Learning Management Systems (LMS) through the separation of content and context,</li><li><b>Pedagogy</b> : SCORM integrates the notion of pre-requisite or <i>sequencing</i> (<i>e.g. </i>\"You cannot go to chapter 2 before passing Quiz 1\"),</li><li><b>Technology</b> : SCORM generates a table of contents as an abstraction layer located outside the content and the LMS. It helps both communicate with each other. Mainly communicated are <i>bookmarks</i>(\"Where is John in the course?\"), <i>scoring</i> (\"How did John pass the test?\") and <i>time</i> (\"How much time did John spent in chapter 1?\").</li></ul><b>How can I create a SCORM-compliant Learning Path?</b><br><br>The obvious way is to use the Chamilo Authoring tool. However, you may prefer to create complete SCORM compliant websites locally on your own computer before uploading it onto your Chamilo platform. In this case, we recommend the use of a sophisticated tool such as Lectora®, eXe Learning® or Reload®<br></p><p>"
msgstr "The Learning Path verktyget har 2 funktioner: <ul><li>Skapa en learning path</li> <li>Ladda upp en Scorm eller IMS baserad learning path</li></ul> <img src=\"../img/path_help.gif\"> <p><b> Vad är en Learning Path ?</b> </p><p>En Learning Path är en sekvens av lärosteg som ingår i moduler. Den kan vara innehållsbaserad (som en innehållsförteckning) eller aktivitets baserad, som en agenda eller en styrd undervisning, vad du behöver för att kunna gå vidare...för att lära dig ett ämne eller 'know-how'.</p><p>Förutom att vara strukturerat, kan en learning path vara sekvenserad. Det betyder att vissa steg är förkunskaper för nästa steg ('du kan inte gå till steg 2 förrän du klarat steg 1 tex.) Din sekvens kan vara suggestiv (visa steg för steg) eller imperativ (du lägger till förkunskaperna så man är tvingad att följa sekvensen).</p> <p><b>Hur skapar man sin egen Learning Path ?</b></p> <p> Det första steget är att gå till Learning Path byggaren. I Learning Path skärmen finns det en länk till den. Där kan du skapa många 'vägar' genom att klicka <i>Lägg till en ny learning path</i>. De kommer att vara tomma, tills du lägger till moduler eller annat innehåll till dem.<br>Om du gör en path synlig, kommer den att dyka upp som ett nytt 'verktyg' i din kurs. På så sätt är det enkelt att komma åt den.</p> <p> <b>Vilka steg kan man lägga till? (vad kan man lägga till?)</b></p> <p>Alla Chamilo aktiviteter eller innehåll kan läggas till: <br><ul> <li>Agenda objekt</li> <li>Dokument (texter, bilder, Office dokument m.m...)</li> <li>Tillkännagivanden</li> <li>Forum</li> <li>Ämnen</li> <li>Individuella ämnen</li> <li>Länkar</li> <li>Dokeos Tester</li> <li>HotPotatoes Tester <br>(N.B : dessa individuella tester som du plockar in i din path, syns för dina elever men bara i path verktyget).</li> <li>Uppgifter</li> <li>Dropbox sidor</li> <li>Externa länkar, de som pekar utanför Chamilo systemet.</li></ul> </p> <p><b> Andra finesser i Learning Path</b> </p> <p> Studenterna kan bes göra din path i en speciell ordning, eftersom du kan bestämma <u>förkunskaperna</u>i path:en. Detta innebär tex. att eleven kan inte gå till övning 2 förrän han läst dokument 1. Alla objekt har en status: avslutad eller oavslutad, så man kan tydligt se elevens framåtskridande. </p><p> Om du förändrar originaltiteln på ett steg, kommer den nya upp i 'pathen', men originaltiteln blir inte raderad. Om du vill test8.doc skall dyka upp som 'final exam' i din path behöver du inte döpa om den, då kan du använda den nya titeln i din 'path'. Det är också användbart med länkar som är väldigt långa. </p><p> När du är klar, glöm inte att kontrollera i studentvyn där innehållsförteckningen dyker upp till vänster och innehållet till höger.</p><br><p><b> Vad är en Scorm eller IMS learning path och hur laddar (importerar) man det?</b> </p> <p>Learning path verktyget tillåter dig att ladda upp Scorm eller IMS kompliant kursmaterial.</p> <p>SCORM (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) är en publik standard som åtföljs av flertalet e-Learning aktörer som NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft, osv och agerar på 3 nivåer: </p> <ul> <li><b>Economy</b> : Ekonomi : Scorm tillåter hela kurser eller små innehåll att återanvändas i olika Learning Management System (LMS) genom separering av innehåll och sammanhang,</li> <li><b> Pedagogik </b> : Scorm integrerar funktionen av förkunskaper eller <i> sekvensering </i>  (tex. \"Du kan inte börja på kapitel 2 innan du svarat på fråga 1\"),</li> <li><b> Teknologi </b> : Scorm genererar en innehållsförteckning som en abstrakt beskrivning både inom och utom LMS:en. Det hjälper innehållet och LMS:en att kommunicera med varandra. Vad som meddelas här är huvudsakligen <i> bokmärken </i>(\"Var är John i kursen?\"), <i> poäng </i> (\"Hur klarade John testet?\") och <i>tid</i> (\"Hur mycket tid har John spenderat i kurs 1?\").</li> </ul> <b>Hur skapar man en Scorm kompliant learning path?</b><br> <br>Det naturligaste sättet är att använda sig av Chamilo Learning Path byggaren.

Skype® etc.) A key advantage of this solution is therefore it's immediate availablilty for students, allowing chat to be easily integrated into the course. Moreover, the Chamilo chat tool will automatically archive discussions and save them for ready access later via the Documents tool. (Be warned that the message may take from 1 to 5 seconds to refresh with each exchange - this doesn't mean anything is wrong!!). </p> If learners have uploaded a profile picture it will appear (reduced in size) in the left column -  otherwise, it will show a default image. </p> It is the responsibility of the teacher to delete threads whenever he/she deems relevant. </p> <b>Educational Use</b> <p>Adding Chat to your course is not always a good idea. To make best use of this tool, you need to ensure discussions remains focussed on course content. You might, for example, decide to keep the chat facility hidden until it is time for a 'formal' scheduled session. That way,while the freedom of discussions may admittedly be curbed, you are able to better guarantee thatsuch live meetings will be beneficial .</p>"

Fördelene är att chatten är direkt integrerad i din kurs och dina diskussioner arkiveras i Dokument verktyget och det behövs inga plugins för att det skall fungera.</p> <p>Om användarna använder en bild i 'min e-portfolio' (topp menyn), då dyker denna bild upp i chatten för att hjälpa läraren att känna igen vem som 'chattar'.</p> <p>Bara läraren är behörig att radera chatten när det behövs.</p> <p><b>Pedagogisk anknytning</b></p> <p>Lägga till en chatt till en kurs behöver inte vara en bra idé, men det kan också vara det.

Can users register to it? You can use these settings dynamically e.g. allow self-registration for one week > ask your students to register > close access to self-registration > remove possible intruders through the Users list. This way you keep control of who is registered while avoiding the administrative hassle of registering them yourself.</p>(Note - some organizations prefer not to use this method and opt to centralise registration. In this case, participants cannot enrol in your course at all, even if you, as a trainer / teacher, wish to give them access. To check this, look at the home page of your campus (as opposed to your course homepage) to see if the 'Register' link is present.) </p> <p>At the bottom of the page, you can back up the course and delete it. Backup will create a file on the server and allow you to copy it on your own Hard Disk locally so that there will be two backups each in different places. If you back up a course and then delete it you will not be be able to restore it yourself, but the system administrator can do this for you if you give him/her the code of your course. Backing up a course is also a good way to get all your documents transferred to your own computer. You will need a tool, like Winzip® to UNZIP the archive.
