<h1>Security guide for Chamilo 2</h1>

<p>We recommend you don't take security concerns lightly. Chamilo is security-audited at least once a year,
    but you're never too sure. This list is a work in progress. Feel free to recommend additional measures by
    sending us an e-mail at info@chamilo.org.</p>

<h2><a id="1.Disclosing-server-info"></a>1. Disclosing server info</h2>
<p>
It is considered safer behaviour not to disclose server information from your Chamilo page. In order to avoid
    both web server and PHP information disclosure, you might want to take the following actions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate the <i>ServerTokens</i> setting inside your Apache configuration and set it to "Prod"</li>
<li>Locate the <i>ServerSignature</i> setting inside your Apache configuration and set it to "Off"</li>
<li>Locate the <i>expose_php</i> setting inside your PHP configuration and set it to "Off"</li>
<li>Reload Apache</li>
</ul>

If you are using Nginx, set <i>server_tokens off;</i> and PHP's expose_php to "Off".

<h2><a id="2.Keeping-up-to-date"></a>2. Keeping up to date</h2>
<p>
Make sure you check <a href="https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/wiki/security-issues">our security issues page</a> regularly.
Follow our security X/Twitter feed: <a href="http://twitter.com/chamilosecurity">http://twitter.com/chamilosecurity</a>.
In Chamilo 2.0, we intend to send you security-related notifications through the "Chamilo News" block on the admin page. Make sure you enable it and check the page regularly.
</p>

<h2><a id="3.Using-safe-browsers"></a>3. Using safe browsers</h2>
<p> Additionally to lacking the implementation of features that really improve the quality of your browsing the
    Internet, older browsers tend to have many unresolved security flaws. Using an old browser, you put in danger the
    security of your computer and the data it contains, but you can also put others in danger by letting crackers take
    control of it and attacking others.</p>
<p>To  avoid being a risk to yourself and others, you should download and install a recent browser. We recommend
    <a href="https://getfirefox.com" target="_blank">the latest stable version of Firefox</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="4.Files-permissions"></a>5. Restricting files permissions</h2>
        <p>Making all the Chamilo files world-writable will help you install quickly, and it solves many
        issues for people without much admin experience. However, it is much more
        secure to make a distinct user owner of all the chamilo files and folders,
        and only give read access to the web server to all files, and write access
            only to the <em>var/</em>.</p>
    <p>This way, these files need
        only be readable and writable by the web server process owner, not by the
        entire world. We also kindly recommend to make all writable directory
        refuse the interpretation of PHP files.</p>
    <p>Don't hesitate to hire an experienced administrator to do that,
        it might be a bit more expensive now, but you'll be happy not to have to loose
        all of your data to a hacker who attacked your site.</p>
    <p>Only the following directory has required write
        permissions from the web server:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>var/</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Because this directory has "write by the web server" permissions,
        it is important to prevent the execution of PHP scripts from it
        (because a specially-crafted attack could end up allowing
        the upload of a PHP script to it). To do that, taking into
        account the fact that we authorize overrides through .htaccess, we need to set
        something that the .htaccess file cannot revert. This can be done as follows inside
        your VirtualHost definition in Apache, where "/var/www/URL/" is the path of your VirtualHost web root:<br />
        <pre>
  &lt;Directory /var/www/URL/var&gt;
    php_admin_value engine Off
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
        </pre>

        For Nginx, this would look like the following rule. However, do
        remember that Nginx interprets rules in order of appearance, so this
        rule would have to be at the top of your location rules to take the
        highest priority:
        <pre>
  location ~ ^/var/.*/.*\.ph(p[3457]?|t|tml|ar)$ {
    deny all;
  }
        </pre>
    <br />
<h2><a id="5.HSTS">HTTP Headers Security</a></h2>
    <p>A valuable addition in web security, HTTP headers can be modified either
    from the web server or from the application (like Chamilo) to increase the security
        of your visitors.</p>
    <p>This implies several aspects, from simple to complex, to deal with, from stuff like
    indicating which websites you say media or libraries can be loaded from, to adding
    extra info about your SSL certificate to make sure a hacked certification authority
        will not immediately make your certificate useless.</p>
    <p>In Chamilo 2.0, we have added several parameters, together with recommendations,
    to the platform settings, Security section, that you are free to use or ignore,
        depending on the level of security you want to achieve.</p>>
    <p>To check your portal for possible improvements in terms of headers security,
        we highly recommend the <a href="https://securityheaders.io/">securityheaders.io</a>
        website. If you want to read more about CSP and all related headers
        security techniques, check <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/">Scott Helme's blog</a>.

<h2><a id="6.SSL">SSL</a></h2>
    <p>SSL helps you protect all communications from and to your Chamilo portal, and it is now considered such
    a fundamental piece of a website's security that it is difficult to ignore. Some features like WebRTC even limit
    their offer considerably if you don't use SSL</p>
    <p>If you have a public URL, you can now easily ask for a free SSL certificate with certbot, which ends up
    being something like this on a Linux server:</p>
    <pre>certbot certonly -d {your domain here}</pre>
    <p>And then editing your web server's configuration to use the freely generated certificate (don't forget to take
    into account that it has to be renewed every 3 months and that your webserver should reload its configuration
    right after the update, each time.</p>
    <p>To test the level of security of your SSL certificate and its configuration in your web server, you can
    use online checkers like <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html">SSLLabs'</a>.</p>
