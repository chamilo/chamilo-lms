<h1>Chamilo 1.9.8.2 - 21st of June, 2014</h1>
<h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
<p>Chamilo 1.9.8.2 is a very little patch version with one bugfix regarding the learning paths tool. Considering the fact that 1.9.8 is planned for the long term, we'd hate to have such a minor patch left on the side for a year or so. This will be packaged and promoted as 1.9.8, but the folder inside the 1.9.8 will be called 1.9.8.2, with a change to this changelog file and a one-line change to main/newscorm/learnpathItem.class.php (as such, you can update just this file to upgrade from 1.9.8.1 to 1.9.8.2. See <a href="https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/commit/642a80e9e838f98f25135fbb64795e4f3df86260">the code change</a> for detais.</p>

<h1>Chamilo 1.9.8.1 - 18th of June, 2014</h1>
<h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
<p>Chamilo 1.9.8.1 is a patch version with one security patch on top of 1.9.8 (in the included library for FCKeditor). Please check <a href="https://support.chamilo.org/projects/chamilo-18/wiki/Security_issues">our security issues page</a> for more information.</p>

<h1>Chamilo 1.9.8 - Thon, 15th of June, 2014</h1>
<h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
<p>Chamilo 1.9.8 is a minor stable version with a series of improvements on top of 1.9.6.<br />
This version is the first Chamilo version to drop support for Internet Explorer
7. We insist that you recommend your users to use modern browsers that respect
web standards. If they *cannot* avoid Internet Explorer, make sure they use at
least version 10, which respects a little bit more than half of the W3C
standards (but still much less than Firefox, Chrome, Opera or even Safari)</p>
<h3>Release name</h3>
<p><a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thon-Samson">Thon</a> is a small city in the Belgian region of Wallonia, several times classified as the most beautiful village of the South region of Belgium. It is a quite, beautiful place without anything out of the ordinary but made of beautiful, hundred years old homes built from famous Wallonia blue stone and crossed by the Samson river. Its stability and it's position just next to the large cliffs surrounding the Meuse are symbolically close to Chamilo 1.9.8, highly stable but a few steps away for the huge jump to the next major version.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
All security issues are published and patches are attached on <a href="https://support.chamilo.org/projects/chamilo-18/wiki/Security_issues">our security issues page</a>. If you think you found an additional security issue you'd like to report, please check our procedure there.

<h3>Stylesheets and theming</h3>
Stylesheets have been considerably changed in version 1.9.8, which might require a little update on your side if you have a custom stylesheet. We're sorry about it, but it was really necessary to improve the adaptability of the interface for mobile devices (which we are sure you will appreciate). If you only changed the logo, we recommend you make a copy of an existing Chamilo style (main/css/chamilo*) again, rename it and simply replace the logo then upload the new style. If you have more complex styles, you might want to ask for the assistance of your web designer at the moment you update Chamilo to this version.
<ul>
    <li>(#6217) Updated logo to new Chamilo logo in config section</li>
    <li>(#7007) Dropped support for IE7</li>

    <li>(d64b865 - BT#8230) Add "section-login" class in login pages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Web services</h3>
<ul>
    <li>(BT#6246) Improved sessions list in sessions_list.soap.php and added GetLearnpathHighestLessonLocation() (also BT#6667)</li>
    <li>(BT#6246) Updated WSCreateUser() to manage active status, added WSGetUser(), WSGetUserFromUsername() and WSSubscribeUserToSessionSimple() and fixed WSListSessions() to allow sessions sales from Ubercart Drupal module</li>
    <li>(43949c7) Add check on existence of extra fields (optional)</li>
    <li>(#6763) Added WSUserSubscribedInCourse()</li>
    <li>(5ddc3c0) Assume student status in EditUser* services and prevent modifying an admin to student</li>
</ul>
<h3>Removals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Custom tabs can no longer be defined directly in the settings_current table.
      If you have custom_tabs in this table (select * from settings_current where variable='show_tabs' AND subkey like 'custom_tab_%'), please add them through the homepage edition screen.</li>
    <li>(#7180) Remove custom_tab_* feature </li>

<h3>Release name</h3>
<p><a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochefort_%28Belgique%29">Rochefort</a> is a small city in the South of Belgium, that has existed at least since year 1041 and has shown impressive resilience and stability, which we think 1.9.6 has reached as well. Rochefort's Brewery produces a very nice trappist beer exported even to Peru!

<h1>Chamilo 1.9.2 - Hanga Roa, 27th of September, 2012</h1>
<h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
<p>Chamilo 1.9.2 is a minor stable version with a series of improvements on top of 1.9.0.</p>

<h3>Release name</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanga_Roa">Hanga Roa</a> is the capital city of Rapa Nui, the Easter Island.

The population there is around 3,300 but warmly welcomes tons of tourists every year, a bit in the image of the small team of Chamilo now serving more than 1.4M users worldwide, with a welcoming 1.9.2 version that will help you get more time to yourself...</p>

<h3>Style changes</h3>
Due to the move to HTML5, it is very likely that any older stylesheet will have to be updated when upgrading to Chamilo 1.9.
<ul>
  <li>Styles changed for all forms</li>
  <li>New top bar added (only for admins)</li>
  <li>Responsive layout for Mobile Devices</li>
</ul>

<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you haven't updated to 1.8.8.6 previously, then you will benefit from 1.8.8.6's security patches by installing 1.9.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Document title:</b> The option to NOT use a document title different than the filename in the documents tool has been removed. This means that if this setting was not set to the default option in your Chamilo option or if you have a very old installation that you have been upgrading over the years, you might experience problems accessing the documents. In this case, we recommend contacting an official provider of Chamilo to take this migration in charge.</li>
  <li>During upgrade, if your database ends with "c_", the installation process will report errors in the PHP error log. This is due to a check on the new c_id field for database normalization, but is not important. The corresponding logging code can be disabled in database.lib.php</li>
  <li>Agenda regression: because we implemented a much more usable and familiar agenda for most of you, and because we lacked some time to go into the details, we have temporarily removed the possibility to make an event visible to specific users (they are always visible to all the course users right now) - see task #5201 for details</li>
  <li>Exercises: When reviewing an exercise, hotspot questions results are not remembered see #3980</li>
  <li>Learning paths: Copying a learning path with embedded documents and exercises from one course to another might cause resource linking problems (images, audio, etc). We recommend copying the complete course and then removing unnecessary elements, or exporting the learning path as SCORM.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Third-Party Libraries additions/updates</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fullcalendar js library version 1.5.2</li>
    <li>Twig Template system added</li>
    <li>Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework</li>
    <li>More libraries were added but haven't been properly registered at this time...</li>
</ul>

<h3>Removals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Removed deprecated "search" plugin (used to work with MnoGoSearch but hasn't been used for years to our knowledge - was successfully replaced by Xapian)</li>
  <li>Removed the RED5 installation guide from the documentation directory: the supported BigBlueButton videoconference system provides its own installation manual, linked from the Chamilo admin guide.</li>
  <li>Removed the "Use document title" option - now we force users to use a document title - this avoids many issues with documents names - see #3781</li>
</ul>

<h1>Chamilo 1.8.8.6 - Rottweil, 20th of July 2012</h1>

<h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
<p>Chamilo 1.8.8.6 is a minor security fix, stable version for version 1.8.8.4. If you are using Chamilo 1.8.8.4, we highly recommend you upgrade to this version, either by following the usual upgrade procedure, or by applying a very small patch, as explained on <a href="http://support.chamilo.org/projects/chamilo-18/wiki/Security_issues">our security issues listing page</a>. The security fixes are all considered "moderate". This means you could loose data (specifically dropbox tool data in this case) and your users might get tricked into providing credentials to potential hackers, but the integrity of your server will not be in direct danger. 1.8.8.6 was developed in a separate branch, but fixes were applied to the 1.9 branch, which means 1.9 can be considered as the follower of 1.8.8.6 as much as of 1.8.8.4. If you have 1.8.8.4, migrating to 1.9 will effectively remove the need for migrating to the intermediary step of 1.8.8.6</p>
<h4>Why Rottweil?</h4>
<p><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.167352,8.627969&hl=fr&ll=48.167352,8.627969&spn=0.006054,0.016512&sll=48.167352,8.627969&sspn=0.006054,0.016512&t=h&z=17">Rottweil</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rottweil">small medieval German town</a> where the occasional tourist might feel very relaxed and secure. This feeling is increased by the obviously-difficult-to-attack strategical position. Considering the security-only aspect of this release, we wanted a small city name that would represent this more secure aspect. Rottweil has been visited by one of our team members in the past... that's all it takes.</p>

<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed long-standing e-mail sending bug (fixed in upstream and documented on the forum and all over the internet)</li>
  <li>Fixed a reflected XSS PHP_SELF security flax in the phpdocx 3rd-party library - #5202</li>
  <li>Fixed an unauthorized file deletion in dropbox by logged in users - #5202</li>
  <li>Fixed XSS unfiltered input in dropbox - #5202</li>
</ul>

  <li>A style-specific switch had been added in 1.8.8.2, which improved the appearance of older style but went against MVC's principles and broke copies of Chamilo-based styles. This switch has been removed, which may lead to the breadcrumb in non-chamilo-based styles to appear as less attractive, but keeps the MVC model safe so anyone can modify the appearance safely from the CSS. This might require very little cosmetic changes from you (in your style's default.css file), but we believe it's for the best.</li>
</ul>

  <li>If you used split users directories before v1.8.8 in combination with the "My files" feature (if it existed at all at that point), you will probably have a problem now, as the code in the previous version was wrong and was saving the personal portfolio file in another directory than the user's. Sorry about that. If you need professional assistance, see the http://www.chamilo.org/ website under support -> professional support for official providers who could help you. And don't forget to keep a backup. If you don't understand a thing about what I'm talking about, you are probable not concerned by this bug, so don't worry too much.</li>

<h1>Chamilo 1.8.8 - Miraflores, May 2011</h1>

<h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
<p>Chamilo 1.8.8 is a major stable version. Although it doesn't come with a strong redesign, it provides a large number of small improvements to the teacher's toolset and the user's using pleasure. Audio recording, schema drawing, certification generating, better administration features, plugin for videoconference with BigBlueButton and e-commerce with PrestaShop are only a few of the improvements that you will find in this version.</p>

<h3>New Features</h3>

   <li>Admin tool to compare and move scores and tracking from a course to a session course BT#1786</li>

   <li>A new UI option "Fill with exemplary content" has been added to the course creation form. Now teachers and platform administrators are able to choose whether example content should be put or not in the courses they are going to create. When a course is not created directly by a user, then the platform setting "Example material on training creation" is taken into account. (Feature # 539)</li>
   <li>Added install/uninstall script possibilities for plugins (BT#1752)</li>
   <li>New SVG-Edit drawing tool. Teachers, students (into his/her user folder) and groups can create, edit and import SVG vector graphics online and export to PNG (Features #2044, #2101)</li>
   <li>A new plugin for making ASCIIsvg-based mathematical graphics has been created for the online editor (enable it from administrator's section). To use it, browsers should support SVG-technology. See a demo, implemented on TinyMCE: <a href="http://www.imathas.com/editordemo/demo.html" target="_blank">http://www.imathas.com/editordemo/demo.html</a>; for syntax and additional information see <a href="http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/svg/asciisvg.html" target="_blank">http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/svg/asciisvg.html</a>. This plugin uses the library file chamilo/main/inc/lib/asciimath/ASCIIMathML.js which has combined functionality ASCIIMathML + ASCIIsvg (Feature #2132)</li>
   <li>Feature #2132: In the administrator's section "Administration &gt; Configuration settings &gt; Editor" some settings are to be used as follows:

<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed more than 10 potential low-impact security issues in wiki (see <a href="http://support.chamilo.org/projects/chamilo-18/wiki/Security_issues">our security page</a> for details).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Groups (admin only): When a user is subscribed in a Course through a Group and he's also subscribed in the same Course (tradional way), when removing the user from the Group, the user will be also removed from the Course in both levels.</li>
  <li>Changed "givenname" for "cn" in LDAP queries. This might break some of the previous implementations of this plugin</li>
  <li>If you used split users directories before v1.8.8 in combination with the "My files" feature (if it existed at all at that point), you will probably have a problem now, as the code in the previous version was wrong and was saving the personal portfolio file in another directory than the user's. Sorry about that. If you need professional assistance, see the http://www.chamilo.org/ website under support -> professional support for official providers who could help you. And don't forget to keep a backup. If you don't understand a thing about what I'm talking about, you are probable not concerned by this bug, so don't worry too much.</li>
  <li>For some reason, we have been reported unsuccessful migrations from 1.8.7 to 1.8.7.1 whereby the course_rel_user table was not integrally copied. We recommend keeping your database backup until you're sure every student/course relationship was copied (comparing the lines in the table before and after migration might help you)</li>
  <li>Document tool: when moving an HTML file using the "move" functionality, images, videos and any incrusted file in that HTML will not be moved automatically see #1278 </li>
  <li>Hotpotatoes: When taking a Hotpotato exam added to Chamilo there is a javascript error, this bug can be only reproduced using Google Chrome see #3332</li>

</ul>
<h3>Deprecated features</h3>
<p>
In order to maintain a sufficient level of stability and push innovation
forward, we have decided to officially drop support for specific features.
This doesn't mean that they won't work anymore, but it indicates that they
will cease being improved slowly, until we do not feel anyone is using them,
at which point (probably several years afterwards) we will remove them from
the code.<br />
If you feel like a feature listed here is of major importance to you, you can
either take the maintenance of this feature officially in charge by contacting
us at info@chamilo.org or you can hire the services of one of our official
providers (see our website, <i>Support</i> tab).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Legacy classes - There is now new code to combine classes with the
  sessions feature or with the courses in a cleaner, more efficient way. We
  invite you to switch to session mode and rebuild your classes through the
  new "Class" option in the sessions block and let us know how that works our
  for you.</li>
  <li>Virtual courses - This feature has long been deprecated and we doubt any
  of our user is using it. If you are, please find another mechanism that suits
  your needs for that.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deprecated files</h3>
<ul>
  <li>main/garbage/ directory</li>
  <li>main/app_share/ was previously the experimental directory for a screen sharing application never deeply implemented. Use BigBlueButton instead, now.
</ul>

<h3>CSS changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CSS factorization - putting all common CSS to main/css/base.css see #3163</li>
  <li>CSS factorization - putting all common CSS classic styles into main/css/base_classic.css see #3163</li>
  <li>CSS factorization - putting all common CSS chamilo_XXX styles into main/css/base_chamilo.css see #3163</li>
  <li>Improving breadcrumb for chamilo_XXX styles, this feature is not enabled for other themes</li>
  <li>Thickbox UI was changed to improved usability</li>

<h1>Chamilo 1.8.7 - Istanbul</h1>


<h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
<p>Chamilo 1.8.7 is a major&nbsp;release including a lot of new features, mostly focused on social network, the handling of sessions (which will help many educational institutions, public or private, to manage their contents in a more flexible way) and visual style, and a few important bugfixes. It lays the first stable stone in the Chamilo software project. This version is the first one to <b>highly recommend PHP 5.2</b> or superior, and <b>require PHP 5.1</b> or higher.<br />Also, this version of Chamilo will automatically convert all your data to UTF-8, which will make it more difficult to migrate from Dokeos versions higher than 1.8.6.1</p>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Full UTF-8 support has been implemented (Feature #272)<ul>
    <li>UTF-8 becomes recommended system encoding to be used. It is also recommended that HTML-documents created with external tools be UTF-8 encoded.</li>

Conversion to UTF-8 of HTML documents stored in the file system is not performed, this is not mandatory.</li>
    <li><em>Note about integration with external systems</em>: Keep in mind that since version 1.8.7, pieces of text kept in the database are UTF-8 encoded. If an external system accesses database records directly, some corrections to contents of the external database might be necessary.</li>

<h1>Dokeos 1.8.6.1 - August 2009</h1>

<h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
<p>Dokeos 1.8.6.1 is a minor&nbsp;release including just a few new features, mostly focused on internationalization, and several bugfixes.</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented new sub-language feature by which language terms redefinition becomes possible through the admin section (FS#4321)</li>
  <li>Admin: Terms and conditions added DT#4320</li>
  <li>Improvements in document tool, allow seeing glossary terms (FS#4337)</li>
  <li>Small improvements in SCORM export(FS#4300)</li>
  <li>At the beginning of the installation script, added an imperative check for PHP 5 has been added. (FS#4296)</li>
  <li>When the system Dokeos is switched into "Test server" mode, a clickable indicator appears in the footer. This indicator is visible by platform administrators only. (FS#4341)</li>
  <li>A transliteration function has been added. Currently, it is used in uploading files. Files with non-English names get names that contain ASCII letters only, remaining readable in the corresponding language. Rationale: The PHP5 run-time environment does not manage file name encodings, adding such a non-native feature involves too much work. For avoiding character encoding problems, transliteration of file names is the possible solution. (FS#306)</li>
  <li>An internationalization option has been added for improving sorting in arbitrary language. When the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php" target="_blank">intl</a> php-extension has been installed, various sorting routines exploit it for better sorting. Rationale: The PHP5 run-time environment does not provide native and reliable way of sorting UTF-8 strings. (FS#306)</li>
  <li>Installation script: The page about system requilements has been updated. Also, at the very beginning, a check has been added whether the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php" target="_blank">mbstring</a> php-extension is installed - see <a href="http://dokeos.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=29548" target="_blank">the related forum topic</a>. (FS#306)</li>
  <li>A new php-based configuration for the online editor has been implemented, see <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/myconfig.php</i>. Also, toolbar definitions have been split in separate php-files within the directory <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/toolbars/</i> . Customization of the editor is more convenient and flexible now. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: A upgrade from FCKEditor 2.6.4 to <strong>FCKEditor 2.6.4.1</strong> has been implemented. (FS#4383)</li>
  <li>Online editor: Blocking copy/paste for trainees has been added. The feature is configurable through editing the toolbar definition files within the directory <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/toolbars/</i> . (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: Preview tabs have been added to the dialogs for inserting video, flv-video, and YouTube video. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: The <strong>audio</strong> plugin has been activated by default as an implementation of the "Insert audio / Audio properties" dialog. This new plugin is intended to replace the "MP3" plugin. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: The simple file manager, the advanced file manager and the image manager have been integrated by default with the editor's dialog system. Thus, they work faster and in a more secure way. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: Configuration of the <strong>mimetex</strong> plugin has been reworked to gain simplicity. The procedure for configuration has been updated, see <a href="http://www.dokeos.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=29594" target="_blank">the related forum topic</a>. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: A new <strong>asciimath</strong> plugin for inserting mathematical formulas has been added. It is based on the <a href="http://mathcs.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html" target="_blank">ASCIIMathML.js</a> library. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Social: Added possibility to define RSS feeds inside personal page of social network (need to define an 'rssfeeds' extra user text field)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Debugging</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Online editor: Several known bug-fixes from FCKEditor 2.6.5 SVN have been implemented, tickets <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/1537" target="_blank">#1537</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2156" target="_blank">#2156</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2689" target="_blank">#2689</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2821" target="_blank">#2821</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2856" target="_blank">#2856</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2874" target="_blank">#2874</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2915" target="_blank">#2915</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3120" target="_blank">#3120</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3181" target="_blank">#3181</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3427" target="_blank">#3427</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3429" target="_blank">#3429</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3439" target="_blank">#3439</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3446" target="_blank">#3446</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3481" target="_blank">#3481</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3677" target="_blank">#3677</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3818" target="_blank">#3818</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3880" target="_blank">#3880</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3925" target="_blank">#3925</a>. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: The toolbar icons have been upgraded to those from FCKEditor 3.0. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>A solution has been implemented for fixing the <a href="http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-529" target="_blank">"__flash__removeCallback" bug</a>, which affects the media player on Internet Explorer browser. (FS#4378 and FS#2867)</li>
