Extra menu from webservice plugin
===============================
This plugin adds a little menu with data provided by external webservice.

# Installation

To install, enable the plugin, then go to "Regions" in the administration panel
and add the region "header left logo" to the plugin. Save.
The plugin should appear as a menu in the upper-left side of the Chamilo portal header.
This plugin requires the php-curl extension to be installed and enabled (a standard Chamilo requirement anyway).
