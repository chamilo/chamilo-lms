"<p> The forum is an discussion tool for asynchronous written work.  In "
"contrast to e-mail, a forum is for public, or semi-public, group discussion. "
"</p>To use the Chamilo forum, members can simply use their browser - they do "
"not require any distinct client software. </p>To organize forums, click on "
"the Forums tool. Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the "
"following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To "
"ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is "
"essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then "
"up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum "
"contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. "
"You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other "
"categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse "
"categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum "
"is useless and not displayed.)</p>\n"
"<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition "
"of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not "
"be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can "
"determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same "
"time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching "
"Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are "
"used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for "
"learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is "
"logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. "
"Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. "
"For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within "

"<p> The forum is an discussion tool for asynchronous written work.  In "

"</p>To use the Chamilo forum, members can simply use their browser - they do "
"not require any distinct client software. </p>To organize forums, click on "
"the Forums tool. Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the "
"following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To "
"ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is "
"essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then "
"up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum "
"contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. "
"You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other "
"categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse "
"categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum "
"is useless and not displayed.)</p>\n"
"<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition "
"of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not "

"time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching "
"Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are "
"used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for "
