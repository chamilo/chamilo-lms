# Embed Registry

Add a new tool in every course to offer embedded content from external sources 
*and* track accesses to the content itself (so you can monitor the interest).

## Set up

Prior to installing/uninstalling this plugin, make sure the src/Chamilo/PluginBundle/Entity folder is
temporarily writeable by the web server.

Enable the plugin. Suggest a default source for all the embedded content, then let teachers define the
content (usually videos) they want to embed into their courses.

Time periods allow teachers to schedule the highlighting of some content above others at specific dates.
