Speech authentication with Whispeak
===================================

**Notice:**

This plugin requires the user to grant permission to use the microphone connected on the web browser. Currently,
browsers are limiting this permission to be used only in a secure environment with HTTPS. 
**If your portal does not work with HTTPS, then Whispeak authentication may not work.**

> properly. This might imply a manual change on your server (outside of the Chamilo interface).
