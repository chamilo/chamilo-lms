In contrast to e-mail, a forum is for public, or semi-public, group discussion. </p>To use the Chamilo forum, members can simply use their browser - they do not require any distinct client software. </p>To organize forums, click on the Forums tool. Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>"

Changing this option will enable a one-level splitting of the directories in the upload directory. 9 directories will be used in the base directory and all subsequent users' directories will be stored into one of these 9 directories. The change of this option will not affect the directories structure on disk, but will affect the behaviour of the Chamilo code, so if you change this option, you have to create the new directories and move the existing directories by yourself on te server. Be aware that when creating and moving those directories, you will have to move the directories of users 1 to 9 into subdirectories of the same name. If you are not sure about this option, it is best not to activate it."
msgstr "Na bardzo mocno obciążonych portalach, gdzie jest zarejestrowanych wielu użytkowników którzy wysyłają swoje zdjęcia, katalog docelowy użytkowników (main/upload/users) może zawierać zbyt wiele plików aby system plików dał sobie z tym radę (zanotowano problemy przy ponad 36.000 plików na serwerze działającym pod systemem Debian). Zmiana tej opcji pozwoli na podział katalogu na 9 katalogów będących na jednym poziomie. Podkatalogi użytkowników będą przechowywane w jednym z tych 9 katalogów. Zmiana tej opcji nie ma wpływu na strukturę katalogów na dysku, ale będą miały wpływ na zachowanie się kodu systemu Chamilo. Jeżeli zmienisz tę opcję, musisz utworzyć nowe katalogi i przenieść ręcznie istniejące katalogi na serwerze. Należy pamiętać, że przy tworzeniu i przenoszenie tych katalogów, musisz przenieść katalogi użytkowników od jednego z 9 katalogi (zachowując tą samą nazwę katalogu użytkownika). Jeśli nie jesteś pewien czy potrzebujesz tej opcji najlepszym wyjściem (domyślnie) jest nie uaktywnianie jej."

msgid "OpenID eliminates the need for multiple logins across different websites, simplifying your online experience. You get to choose the OpenID Provider that best meets your needs and most importantly that you trust. At the same time, your OpenID can stay with you, no matter which Provider you move to. And best of all, the OpenID technology is not proprietary and is completely free.For businesses, this means a lower cost of password and account management, while drawing new web traffic. OpenID lowers user frustration by letting users have control of their login.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://openid.net/what/\">Read on...</a>"
msgstr "OpenID eliminuje potrzebę stosowania wielu loginów w różnych stronach internetowych, upraszczając Ci korzystanie z Internetu. Musisz wybrać dostawcę OpenID, który najlepiej spełnia Twoje potrzeby i co najważniejsze, któremu możesz zaufać. Twój OpenID zostaje z Tobą, bez względu na to, czy przeniesiesz się do innego Dostawcy. A najlepsze jest to, że technologia OpenID nie jest zastrzeżona i jest całkowicie darmowa. Dla firm oznacza to niższe koszty hasła i zarządzania kontem, czerpiąc z nowego ruchu w sieci. OpenID zmniejsza frustrację użytkownika, dając użytkownikom kontrolę nad ich loginem."

Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and is not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>"

msgid "The Course tool supports two approaches :<ul><li>Create a new course (allowing you to author your own content)</li><li>Import SCORM course</li></ul><img src=\"../img/path_help.gif\"><p><b>What is a Learning Path?</b></p><p>A Learning Path allows for the presentation of a sequence of learning experiences or activities arranged in distinct sections (in this sense, the Learning Path is what distinguishes a 'course' from a mere repository of random documents). It can be content-based (serving as a table of contents) or activities-based, serving as an agenda or program of action necessary to understand and apply a particular area of knowledge or skill.</p><p>In addition to being  structured, a Learning Path can also be <i>sequential</i>, meaning that the completion of certain steps constitute pre-requisites for accessing others (i.e. 'you cannot go to learning object 2 before learning object 1'). Your sequence can be <i>suggestive</i> (simply displaying steps one after the other) or <i>prescriptive</i> (involving pre-requisites so that learners are required to follow steps in a particular order).</p><p><b>How do I create my own Learning Path (Course)?</b></p><p>Proceed to the 'Learning Path' section.  There you can create as many courses/paths as you wish by clicking the <i>Create a new course</i> tool. You will need to choose a name for the course/path (e.g. <i>Unit 1</i> if you plan to create several units within the overall course). To begin with, the course is empty, waiting for you to add sections and learning objects to it.<br>If you set a course to Visible, it will appear as a new tool on the course homepage. This makes it easier and clearer for students to access.</p><p><b>What learning objects can I add?</b></p><p>All Chamilo tools, activities and content that you consider useful and relevant to your course can be added :<br><ul><li>Separate documents (texts, pictures, Office docs, ...)</li><li>Forums as a whole</li><li>Topics</li><li>Links</li><li>Chamilo Tests</li><li>HotPotatoes Tests<br />(note :tests made invisible on the homepage, but included in a path, become visible for learners only as they work through the course.)</li><li>Assignments</li><li>External links</li></ul></p><p><b>Other features</b></p><p>Learners can be asked to follow your course in a given order, as you can set <u>pre-requisites</u>. This means for example that learners cannot go to e.g. Quiz 2 until they have read e.g. Document 1. All learning objects have a status:<i>completed</i> or <i>incomplete</i>, so the progress of learners is clearly reported.</p><p>If you alter the original title of a learning object, the new name will appear in the course, but the original title will not be deleted. So if you want test8.doc to appear as 'Final Exam' in the path, you do not have to rename the file, you can use the new title in the path. It is also useful to give new titles to links which are too long.</p><p>When you're finished, don't forget to check Display mode, (showing, as in learner view, the table of contents on the left and the learning objects on the right,one at a time.)</p><br><p><b>What is a SCORM course and how do I import one?</b></p><p>The learning path tool allows you to upload SCORM-compliant courses.</p><p>SCORM  (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) is a public standard followed by major e-Learning companies like NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft, etc. They act at three levels:</p><ul><li><b>Economy</b> : SCORM renders whole courses or small content units reusable on different Learning Management Systems (LMS) through the separation of content and context,</li><li><b>Pedagogy</b> : SCORM integrates the notion of pre-requisite or <i>sequencing</i> (<i>e.g. </i>\"You cannot go to chapter 2 before passing Quiz 1\"),</li><li><b>Technology</b> : SCORM generates a table of contents as an abstraction layer located outside the content and the LMS. It helps both communicate with each other. Mainly communicated are <i>bookmarks</i>(\"Where is John in the course?\"), <i>scoring</i> (\"How did John pass the test?\") and <i>time</i> (\"How much time did John spent in chapter 1?\").</li></ul><b>How can I create a SCORM-compliant Learning Path?</b><br><br>The obvious way is to use the Chamilo Authoring tool. However, you may prefer to create complete SCORM compliant websites locally on your own computer before uploading it onto your Chamilo platform. In this case, we recommend the use of a sophisticated tool such as Lectora®, eXe Learning® or Reload®<br></p><p>"

Dzięki temu masz kontrolę na tym, kto się na kurs zapisuje, nie masz jednak administracyjnej władzy zapisywania studentów samemu.</p> <p>Na dole strony możesz utworzyć Wersję zapasową kursu i go skasować. Wersja zapasowa utworzy plik na serwerze i pozwoli na lokalne zapisanie go na Twój dysk twardy. Będą, więc dwie wersje zapasowe w dwóch różnych miejscach. Jeśli zrobisz wersję zapasową kursu - skasuj go. Nie będziesz w stanie przywrócić go samemu, ale administrator systemu może to zrobić, jeśli poda się mu kod kursu. Tworzenie wersji zapasowej jest również dobrą metodą na ściągnięcie wszystkich dokumentów z kursem związanych z powrotem na własny komputer. Będzie Ci potrzebne narzędzie takie jak Winzip® aby rozpakować pliki. Zwróć uwagę, że tworzenie wersji zapasowej kursu nie kasuje go. </p>"

msgid "<p>Chamilo is a modular tool. You can hide and show tools whenever you want, according to the requirements of your project or to a particular chronological part of it. But you can also add tools or pages to your home page that you have created yourself or that come from outwith your Chamilo portal. That way, you can customise your course home page to make it your own.</p><p>In so doing, you will doubtless want to add your own links to the page. Links can be of two types:<ul><li><b>External link</b>: you create a link on your home page to a website situated outside your course area. In this case, you will select 'Target= In a new window' because you don't want that website to replace your Chamilo environment.</li><li><b>Internal link</b>: you link to a page or a tool inside your Chamilo course. To do this, first go to the relevant page (or document, or tool), copy its URL from the address bar of your browser (CTRL+C), then you go to 'Add link' and  paste this URL in the URL field, giving it whatever name you want. In this case, you will select 'Target=Same window' because you want to keep the Chamilo banner on top and the link page in the same environment.</li></ul>Once created, links cannot be edited. To modify them, the only solution is to deactivate and delete them, then start over.</p>"

W ten sposób możesz zrobić ze strony głównej swojego kursu - SWOJĄ stronę.</p> <p>Aby to uczynić, dodaj do swojej strony linki. Mogą one być dwojakiego rodzaju: <ul><li><b>Linki zewnętrzne</b>: na swojej stronie umieszczasz link odnoszący się do strony spoza obszaru Twojego kursu. W tym przypadku wybierasz Cel= W nowym oknie gdyż nowa strona mogłaby zastąpić środowisko Chamiloa.</li><li><b>Linki wewnętrzne</b>: link odnosi się narzędzia lub strony znajdujących się wewnątrz kursu Chamilo'a. Aby to zrobić, idź najpierw do tej strony, dokumentu lub narzędzia, skopiuj jego URL z paska URL Twojej przeglądarki (CTRL+C), później idź do Dodaj link i wklej URL do pola do tego przeznaczonego i nadaj linkowi jakąś nazwę. W tym przypadku należy wybrać Cel= To samo okno ponieważ baner Chamilo'a wciąż będzie na wierzchu i pozostaniesz w tym samym środowisku.</li></ul> Raz stworzone linki nie mogą być edytowane.

Filling in the text fields 'Survey introduction' and 'Survey thanks' is also good practice; this will add clarity and a certain friendliness to your survey.</p> <p><b>Adding questions to the survey</b></p> <p>Once the survey outline is created, it is up to you to create the questions. The 'Survey' tool has many question types: open/closed questions, percentage, QCM, multiple responses... You should certainly find everything you need for your (ever increasing) feedback requirements.</p>  <p><b>Previewing the survey</b></p><p>Once you have created questions, you may want to check what the survey will look like to learners. Click on the 'Preview' icon and the preview screen will show you exactly this.</p> <p><b>Publishing the survey</b></p> <p>Happy with the preview? Any modifications to be made? No? Then click on the icon 'Publish survey' to send the survey to the selected list of recipients. As with creating groups, use the list 'Users of this course' on the left and the one for 'receivers' on its right to arrange this. Next, fill in the e-mail subject 'Title of the e-mail' and the content, 'Text of the e-mail'. Potential surveyees will be alerted by e-mail of the availability of a survey. Think carefully about  the wording of the e-mail  because it will play a big part in motivating users to take the survey.</p>  <p><b>Survey reports</b></p> Analysing surveys is a tedious task.
