In contrast to e-mail, a forum is for public, or semi-public, group discussion. </p>To use the Chamilo forum, members can simply use their browser - they do not require any distinct client software. </p>To organize forums, click on the Forums tool. Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>"

You get to choose the OpenID Provider that best meets your needs and most importantly that you trust. At the same time, your OpenID can stay with you, no matter which Provider you move to. And best of all, the OpenID technology is not proprietary and is completely free.For businesses, this means a lower cost of password and account management, while drawing new web traffic. OpenID lowers user frustration by letting users have control of their login.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://openid.net/what/\">Read on...</a>"

Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and is not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>"

Labajā stūrī  tu vari piekļūt instrumentiem uzklikšķinot uz ikonas.Un nav atšķirības, vai tu izvēlēsies kursa kodu kreisajā pusē(vienmēr rakstīts ar LIELAJIEM BURTIEM), vai arī uzklikšķini mājas ikonu labajā pusē, tu tik un tā atgriezīsies  kursa izstrādes lapā.</p><b>Labākās metodes</b><p>Lai motivētu savus Kursantus, ir svarīgi, lai būtu dinamiska apmācību vide. Tas nozīmē, ka tiks parādīts, ka \"kāds ir ekrāna otrajā pusē\". Ātrākais veids, kā panākt šo sajūtu ir rediģēt Iepazīstināšanas tekstu(noklikšķini uz dzeltenā zīmuļa) vismaz reizi nedēļā, lai paziņotu pēdējos jaunumus, atgādinātu par darbu iesniegšanas termiņiem utml.</p><p>Lai izveidotu savu kursu, ir nepieciešams veikt sekojošus soļus:<ol><li>Kursa uzstādījumos pārbaudi Pieeju kursiem : Privāts un parakstīšanās: Nav atļauts. Šajā gadījumā neviens nevar piekļūt kursam veidošanās procesā.</li><li>Rādīt visus instrumentus uzklikšķinot uz pelēkās saites lapas augšpusē.</li><li>Lieto nepieciešamos instrumentus, lai aizpildītu tavus laukus, piem., saturs, notikumi, vadlīnijas, testi utt.</li><li>Noslēp visus instrumentus: Kursanta skatā tava mājaslapa ir tukša.</li><li>Lieto Ceļa rīku, lai strukturizētu veidu, kā Kursanti apmeklēs lapu un mācīsies. Šajā gadījumā, tu izmantosi citus instrumentus, bet pirmajā lapā tos neparādīsi.</li><li>Uzklikšķini uz acs ikonas  bez tevis izveidotā ceļa: šis ceļš tiks parādīts tava mājaslapā.</li><li>Tava kursa lauka sagatavošana ir pabeigta. Tavā mājaslapā tiks parādīts ievada teksts un aiz tā tikai viena saite, kas vedīs Kursantus cauri visam kursam. Uzklikšķini uz Kursanta skata(augšā pa labi), lai redzētu, kā tas izskatās no Kursanta redzes viedokļa.<l></l></li></ol>"

msgid "The Course tool supports two approaches :<ul><li>Create a new course (allowing you to author your own content)</li><li>Import SCORM course</li></ul><img src=\"../img/path_help.gif\"><p><b>What is a Learning Path?</b></p><p>A Learning Path allows for the presentation of a sequence of learning experiences or activities arranged in distinct sections (in this sense, the Learning Path is what distinguishes a 'course' from a mere repository of random documents). It can be content-based (serving as a table of contents) or activities-based, serving as an agenda or program of action necessary to understand and apply a particular area of knowledge or skill.</p><p>In addition to being  structured, a Learning Path can also be <i>sequential</i>, meaning that the completion of certain steps constitute pre-requisites for accessing others (i.e. 'you cannot go to learning object 2 before learning object 1'). Your sequence can be <i>suggestive</i> (simply displaying steps one after the other) or <i>prescriptive</i> (involving pre-requisites so that learners are required to follow steps in a particular order).</p><p><b>How do I create my own Learning Path (Course)?</b></p><p>Proceed to the 'Learning Path' section.  There you can create as many courses/paths as you wish by clicking the <i>Create a new course</i> tool. You will need to choose a name for the course/path (e.g. <i>Unit 1</i> if you plan to create several units within the overall course). To begin with, the course is empty, waiting for you to add sections and learning objects to it.<br>If you set a course to Visible, it will appear as a new tool on the course homepage. This makes it easier and clearer for students to access.</p><p><b>What learning objects can I add?</b></p><p>All Chamilo tools, activities and content that you consider useful and relevant to your course can be added :<br><ul><li>Separate documents (texts, pictures, Office docs, ...)</li><li>Forums as a whole</li><li>Topics</li><li>Links</li><li>Chamilo Tests</li><li>HotPotatoes Tests<br />(note :tests made invisible on the homepage, but included in a path, become visible for learners only as they work through the course.)</li><li>Assignments</li><li>External links</li></ul></p><p><b>Other features</b></p><p>Learners can be asked to follow your course in a given order, as you can set <u>pre-requisites</u>. This means for example that learners cannot go to e.g. Quiz 2 until they have read e.g. Document 1. All learning objects have a status:<i>completed</i> or <i>incomplete</i>, so the progress of learners is clearly reported.</p><p>If you alter the original title of a learning object, the new name will appear in the course, but the original title will not be deleted. So if you want test8.doc to appear as 'Final Exam' in the path, you do not have to rename the file, you can use the new title in the path. It is also useful to give new titles to links which are too long.</p><p>When you're finished, don't forget to check Display mode, (showing, as in learner view, the table of contents on the left and the learning objects on the right,one at a time.)</p><br><p><b>What is a SCORM course and how do I import one?</b></p><p>The learning path tool allows you to upload SCORM-compliant courses.</p><p>SCORM  (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) is a public standard followed by major e-Learning companies like NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft, etc. They act at three levels:</p><ul><li><b>Economy</b> : SCORM renders whole courses or small content units reusable on different Learning Management Systems (LMS) through the separation of content and context,</li><li><b>Pedagogy</b> : SCORM integrates the notion of pre-requisite or <i>sequencing</i> (<i>e.g. </i>\"You cannot go to chapter 2 before passing Quiz 1\"),</li><li><b>Technology</b> : SCORM generates a table of contents as an abstraction layer located outside the content and the LMS. It helps both communicate with each other. Mainly communicated are <i>bookmarks</i>(\"Where is John in the course?\"), <i>scoring</i> (\"How did John pass the test?\") and <i>time</i> (\"How much time did John spent in chapter 1?\").</li></ul><b>How can I create a SCORM-compliant Learning Path?</b><br><br>The obvious way is to use the Chamilo Authoring tool. However, you may prefer to create complete SCORM compliant websites locally on your own computer before uploading it onto your Chamilo platform. In this case, we recommend the use of a sophisticated tool such as Lectora®, eXe Learning® or Reload®<br></p><p>"

Tas var būt uz saturu balstīts(izskatās kā satura rādītājs) vai uz uzdevumiem balstīts, kā darāmo darbu saraksts vai programma, lai saprastu un izmēģinatu praksē zināšanas.</p><p> Lai būtu strukturēts, mācību plānam jābūt secīgam. Tas nozīmē, ka daži soļi izveidos pirmsrekvizītus citiem(\"tu nevari uzsākt soli 2 pirms 1 soļa\") . Tavam rezultātam jābūt ierosinošam(parādi soļus vienu pēc otra) vai pavēlšām (tu pievieno pirmsrekvizītus, tāpēc cilvēki spiesti sekot secībai). </p> <p><b>Kā izveidot savu mācību plānu?</b></p> <p> Pirmais solis ir nonākt Mācību plāna cēlāja sadaļā. Mācību plāna logā ir saite uz to. Tur tu vari izveidot daudz saites klikšķinot uz <i>Pievienot jaunu mācību plānu</i>. Bet tie ir tukši, kamēr tu tiem nepievieno moduļus un soļus.<br>Ja tu padari saiti redzamu, kursa mājaslapā tā parādīsies kā jauns rīks. Tādējādi piekļūšana tam ir vieglāka.</p> <p> <b>Kādi ir šī plāna  soļi?

Visām vienībām ir piešķirts statuss: pabeigts vai nepabeigts,tādējādi ir iespējams noteikt studenta virzīšanos uz priekšu.</p><p>Ja tu mainīsi soļa oriģīnālo nosaukumu, šis nosaukums parādīsies mācību plānā, taču oriģinālais nosaukums netiks izdzēsts. Tātad, ja tu mācību planā vēlies test8.doc pārsaukt par \"Pēdējo pārbaudījumu\", tev nav jāpārsauc dokuments, bet vari izmantot jauno nosaukumu mācību planā. Ir lietderīgi dot jaunu nosaukumus tām saitēm, kuru nosaukums ir pārak garš. </p><p> Kad tas ir pabeigts, neaizmirsti pārbaudīt studenta skatu, kurā satura rādītājs atrodas pa kreisi un plāna soļi parasti viens aiz otra atrodas labaja pusē.</p><br><p><b> Kas ir Scorm vai IMS formāta Mācību plans un kā to augšupielādet(importēt)?</b> </p> <p>Mācību plāna rīks ļauj ielādēt SCORM un IMS kursu saturu.</p> <p>SCORM (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) ir standarts, ko ievēro galvenās eApmācības kompānijas.NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft, utt. un piedalās 3 līmeņos: </p> <ul> <li><b>Ekonomikā</b> : Scorm ļauj izmantot visu kursu vai nelielu tā daļu izmantot citām apmācības pārvaldības sistēmām atdalot saturu un kontekstu,</li> <li><b>Pedagoģija</b> : Scorm integrē pirmsrekvizītus vai <i>secīgumu</i> (<i>piem. </i>\"Tu nevari doties uz 2nodaļu pirms neesi nokartojis 1.kontroldarbu.\"),</li> <li><b>Tehnoloģijas</b> : Scorm ģenerē satura rādītāju kā abstrakciju līmeni, kas atrodas ārpus satura un ārpus mācīšanās pārvaldības sistēmām(MPS).  Tas palīdz MPS un saturam komunicēt savā starpā.Galvenokārt komunicēsanās ir:<i>grāmatzīmes </i>(\"Cik tālu Jānis ir apguvis kursu?\"), <i>vērtēšana</i> (\"Kā Jānis nokārtoja kontroldarbu?\") un <i>laiks</i> (\"Cik daudz laika Jānis pavadīja apgūstot 1.paragrāfu?\").</li> </ul> <b>Kā izveidot SCORM mācību plānu?</b><br> <br> Visdabiskākais veids ir izmantot Dokeos Mācību plāna cēlāju.

To make best use of this tool, you need to ensure discussions remains focussed on course content.
