Mailing new LPs to students and their HR Managers
======

This plugin allows you to enable the sending of emails to students and their human resources managers at the moment an
LP is published.

For its operation, it is necessary that there is an extra field notify_student_and_hrm_when_available with default_value
equal to 1, which will enable the possibility of executing the main/cron/learning_path_reminder.php cron to send
the emails to the users registered in the lp and to their hr.

It is recommended that it be run once a day since it evaluates all lp's in the range from 0:00 to 23:59.
