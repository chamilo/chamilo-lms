FOSUserBundle Emails
====================

The FOSUserBundle has built-in support for sending emails in two different
instances.

Registration Confirmation
-------------------------

The first is when a new user registers and the bundle is configured
to require email confirmation before the user registration is complete.
The email that is sent to the new user contains a link that, when visited,
will verify the registration and enable the user account.

Requiring email confirmation for a new account is turned off by default.
To enable it, update your configuration as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_user:
        # ...
        registration:
            confirmation:
                enabled: true

Password Reset
--------------

An email is also sent when a user has requested a password reset. The
FOSUserBundle provides password reset functionality in a two-step process.
First the user must request a password reset. After the request has been
made, an email is sent containing a link to visit. Upon visiting the link,
the user will be identified by the token contained in the url. When the user
visits the link and the token is confirmed, the user will be presented with
a form to enter in a new password.

Default Mailer Implementations
------------------------------

The bundle comes with three mailer implementations. They are listed below
by service id:

- ``fos_user.mailer.default`` is the default implementation, and uses Swiftmailer to send emails.
- ``fos_user.mailer.twig_swift`` uses Swiftmailer to send emails and Twig blocks to render the message.
- ``fos_user.mailer.noop`` is a mailer implementation which performs no operation, so no emails are sent.

.. note::

    The ``fos_user.mailer.noop`` mailer service should be used in the case
    where you do not want the bundle to send emails and you do not want to
    include the SwiftmailerBundle in your app. If you leave the default implementation
    configured as the mailer and do not have the SwiftmailerBundle registered,
    you will receive an exception because of a missing dependency.

Configuring the Sender Email Address
------------------------------------

The FOSUserBundle default mailer allows you to configure the sender email address
of the emails sent out by the bundle. You can configure the address globally or on
a per email basis.

To configure the sender email address for all emails sent out by the bundle, simply
update your ``fos_user`` config as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_user:
        #...
        from_email:
            address:        noreply@example.com
            sender_name:    Demo App

The bundle also provides the flexibility of allowing you to configure the sender
email address for the emails individually.

To configure the sender email address for the user registration confirmation
email update your ``fos_user`` config as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_user:
        #...
        registration:
            confirmation:
                from_email:
                    address:        registration@example.com
                    sender_name:    Demo Registration

You can similarly update the ``fos_user`` config to change the sender email address for
the password reset request email:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_user:
        #...
        resetting:
            email:
                from_email:
                    address:        resetting@example.com
                    sender_name:    Demo Resetting

Sending HTML mails
------------------

The default mailer only supports sending plain text messages. If you want
to send multipart messages, the easiest solution is to use the TwigSwiftMailer
implementation instead. It expects your twig template to define 3 blocks:

- ``subject`` containing the email subject
- ``body_text`` rendering the plain text version of the message
- ``body_html`` rendering the html mail

Here is how you can use it, you can use either of the two methods
of referencing the email template below.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_user:
        # ...
        service:
            mailer: fos_user.mailer.twig_swift
        resetting:
            email:
                template:   email/password_resetting.email.twig
        registration:
            confirmation:
                template:   '@FOSUser/Registration/email.txt.twig'

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {# app/Resources/views/email/password_resetting.email.twig #}

    {% block subject %}Resetting your password{% endblock %}

    {% block body_text %}
    {% autoescape false %}
    Hello {{ user.username }} !

    You can reset your password by accessing {{ confirmationUrl }}

    Greetings,
    the App team
    {% endautoescape %}
    {% endblock %}

    {% block body_html %}
    {#
        You can of course render the html directly here.
        Including a template as done here allows keeping things DRY by using
        the template inheritance in it
    #}
    {% include 'email/password_resetting.html.twig' %}
    {% endblock %}

.. note::

    The HTML part is set in the message only when the ``body_html`` block is
    not empty.

You can view the default email templates at
`@FOSUser/Registration/email.txt.twig` and
`@FOSUser/Resetting/email.txt.twig`

Using A Custom Mailer
---------------------

The default mailer service used by FOSUserBundle relies on the Swiftmailer
library to send mail. If you would like to use a different library to send
emails, want to send HTML emails or simply change the content of the email you
may do so by defining your own service.

First you must create a new class which implements ``FOS\UserBundle\Mailer\MailerInterface``
which is listed below.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    namespace FOS\UserBundle\Mailer;

    use FOS\UserBundle\Model\UserInterface;

    /**
     * @author Thibault Duplessis <thibault.duplessis@gmail.com>
     */
    interface MailerInterface
    {
        /**
         * Send an email to a user to confirm the account creation
         *
         * @param UserInterface $user
         */
        function sendConfirmationEmailMessage(UserInterface $user);

        /**
         * Send an email to a user to confirm the password reset
         *
         * @param UserInterface $user
         */
        function sendResettingEmailMessage(UserInterface $user);
    }

After you have implemented your custom mailer class and defined it as a service,
you must update your bundle configuration so that FOSUserBundle will use it.
Simply set the ``mailer`` configuration parameter under the ``service`` section.
An example is listed below.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_user:
        # ...
        service:
            mailer: app.custom_fos_user_mailer

To see an example of a working implementation of the ``MailerInterface``
see the `ZetaMailer`_ class of the `ZetaWebmailBundle`_. This implementation
uses the Zeta Components Mail to send emails instead of Swiftmailer.
