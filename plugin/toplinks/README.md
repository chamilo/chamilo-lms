# Top Links

As an administrator (from the administration page in the plugin block) you will be able to create new links, that will appear in all courses as a new tool.
Those new links/tools will appear first in the list of tools for learners.

## Configuration

1. Install the plugin
2. Assign the `pre_footer` and `menu_administrator` regions to the plugin.
