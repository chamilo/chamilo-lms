    <h1>Credits</h1>

    In the past, we maintained a list of contributors to the Chamilo project along with a description of their
    contribution. This list is still available <a href="legacy/credits.html">here</a>, but as the project grew in
    size and complexity, maintaining this list became more and more time-consuming to the point we could not maintain
    it anymore.

        Today's contributions are mainly obtainable through several platforms' logs:
        <ul>
            <li>Code contributions can be found in <a href="https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/commits/master/">Github's list of commits</a> for the corresponding branch.</li>
            <li>Translators contributions can be found on <a href="https://translation.chamilo.org/">our translations website</a>, but you have to have a valid account to access them.</li>
            <li>Documentation contributions can be found in each guide's appendix in our <a href="https://docs.chamilo.org">online documentation</a></li>
        </ul>
