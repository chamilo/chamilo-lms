AI Helper plugin
======

Version 1.1

> This plugin is meant to be later integrated into Chamilo (in a major version
release).

The AI helper plugin integrates into parts of the platform that seem the most useful to teachers/trainers or learners. 
Because available Artificial Intelligence (to use the broad term) now allows us to ask for meaningful texts to be generated, we can use those systems to pre-generate content, then let the teacher/trainer review the content before publication.

Currently, this plugin is only integrated into:

 - exercises: in the Aiken import form, scrolling down
 - learnpaths: option to create one with openai

### OpenAI/ChatGPT

The plugin, created in early 2023, currently only supports OpenAI's ChatGPT API. 
Create an account at https://beta.openai.com/signup, then generate a secret key at https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys and fill it inside the key field in the plugin configuration page.

# Changelog
