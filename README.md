Chamilo is an e-learning platform, also called "LMS" or "LCMS" published under GNU/GPLv3+. It is or has been used by more than 20M people worldwide.

## Quick install

**Chamilo 2.0 is still in development stage. This install procedure is for reference only. For a stable Chamilo, please install Chamilo 1.11.x. See the 1.11.x branch README.md for details.**

We assume you have already installed "yarn" and "composer" and you're installing the portal in a domain,
not in a sub folder inside a domain.

~~~~
# on a fresh Ubuntu, you can prepare your server by issuing an apt command like the following
apt update && apt -y upgrade && apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-php mariadb-client mariadb-server php-pear php-dev php-gd php-curl php-intl php-mysql php-mbstring php-zip php-xml php-cli php-apcu php-bcmath git unzip
# otherwise, you can use the following directly:
git clone https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms.git chamilo2
cd chamilo2
composer install (If composer asks to accept recipes, just press enter or "n")
php bin/console fos:js-routing:dump --format=json --target=public/js/fos_js_routes.json
yarn install
yarn run encore dev
chmod -R 777 .
~~~~

Then enter the main/install/index.php and follow the UI instructions (database, admin user settings, etc).

After the web install process, change the permissions back to a reasonnably safe state:
~~~~
chmod -R 755 .
chown -R www-data: public/ var/
~~~~

### Quick update

If you have already installed it and just want to update it from Git, do:
~~~~
git pull origin master
composer update
php bin/console fos:js-routing:dump --format=json --target=public/js/fos_js_routes.json
    
yarn upgrade
yarn encore dev
~~~~
This will update the JS (yarn) and PHP (composer) dependencies.


## Installation guide (Dev environment, stable environment not yet available)

If you are a developer and want to contribute to Chamilo in the current development branch (not stable yet), 
then please follow the instructions below. Please bear in mind that the development version is NOT COMPLETE at this time, 
and many features are just not working yet. This is because we are working on root components that require massive changes to the structure of the code, files and database. As such, to get a working version, you might need to completely uninstall and re-install from time to time. You've been warned.

First, apply the procedure described here: [Managing CSS and JavaScript in Chamilo](assets/README.md) (in particular, make sure you follow the given links to install all the necessary components on your computer).

Then make sure your database supports large prefixes (see [this Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43379717/how-to-enable-large-index-in-mariadb-10/43403017#43403017) if you use MySQL < 5.7 or MariaDB < 10.2.2).

Load the (your-domain)/main/install/index.php URL to start the installer (which is very similar to the installer in previous versions). 
If the installer is pure-HTML and doesn't appear with a clean layout, that's because you didn't follow these instructions carefully. 
Go back to the beginning of this section and try again.

Finally, if you are installing this development version in a subdirectory, you will need to add "the folder" in the ".env" file in the root folder:
```
APP_URL_APPEND=the-folder
```
