    <h1>Chamilo 2.0 - [release name],  2024-mm-dd</h1>
    <h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
    <p>Chamilo 2.0 is a major release that starts a new branch for the Chamilo software.
    It is based on Chamilo 1.11.10, but includes tons of backend changes that will make
    developing Chamilo more "mainstream" in the future, by adopting more widely-known libraries,
    with the notable inclusions of Symfony as a main controller and framework (except for
    some legacy tools not yet converted) and VueJS as a main UI framework.<br />
    For the first time in more than 14 years (since its launch in 2010), Chamilo changes appearance, with a totally
    new and streamlined set of icons, and a design that will allow more flexibility and speed across devices.</p>

    <h3>Security fixes</h3>
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li>None</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Possibly breaking changes</h3>
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li>Database: All "name" fields have been renamed "title" for consistency across the system.</li>
        <li>Database: As much as possible, tables containing records that had been deleted in Chamilo 1.* are migrated without such records. This means less "ghost" content, but also that the content deleted that way in Chamilo 1.* now has become completely unrecoverable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable new Features</h3>.
    <h4>For end-users</h4>
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li>Messages: Messaging can now be made to several people at once from the messages interface (and replies can be made to the same users).</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For teachers/trainers</h4>
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For Chamilo admins</h4>
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For developers or sysadmins</h4>
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li>Messages: Message attachment are no longer replicated the number of times they are received (for example through an announcement). This saves considerable space on large portals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>General improvements (including major features, minor features and patches)</h3>
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stylesheets and theming changes</h3>
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Web services changes</h3>
    Web services are now documented at https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/wiki/webservices-api-latest, including
    its own changelog. If you need consistent tracking of these changes, we recommend you use that page for more
    complete information.

    In Chamilo 2.0, we have moved from SOAP and REST individual implementations to using
    <a href="https://api-platform.com/">API Platform</a> to generate web services. This enables more flexibility for
    us and for users of our API, as there are more ways to access our data, while providing us with easy ways to
    develop new services.
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li>Added API Platform endpoint "/api"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Removals</h3>
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li>Plugins: Many plugins that seemed either unused or were not maintained by their maintainers. They could be included later on, and their tables have not been removed in the database, but they are not available in the list of plugins.</li>
        <li>Wiki: The wiki tool is not available *yet*. It will be included again in future versions, but there were too many changes required to include it in v2.0.</li>
        <li>Blogs: The blogs tool is not available. It might be included again in future versions, but there were too many changes required to include it in v2.0.</li>
        <li>Dropbox: The dropbox tool is not available. It might be included again in future versions, but there were too many changes required to include it in v2.0.</li>
        <li>Global: Sub-folder mode: Chamilo 2 will not support being installed in a sub-folder. Nowadays, defining a subdomain has become very easy and provides higher security and more configuration flexibility, and supporting sub-folders is a complex task.</li>
        <li>Display: Upon migration, the stylesheets are reset to the default Chamilo stylesheet. You will have to redesign your stylesheets using the stylesheets tool in the admin UI.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Known issues</h3>
    <ul aria-live="off">
        <li>DB title vs name fields: There have been *many* (several hundreds) database changes between v1.* and v2.0. These changes include renaming all "name" fields in all tables to "title", to follow a common standard. This particular change has required dozens of hours of expert work, because the "name" text is very common and the Chamilo 1.* was not *that* well structured. However, we may still have missed a few ones. If you find one, please report it as an issue in our repository.</li>
        <li>Customizations in course tools (titles, icons, etc) at the course level are lost in migration.</li>
    </ul>
