This plugin adds Zoom meetings, user registration to meetings and meeting recordings.

## Meetings

A **meeting** can be linked to a local **user** and/or a local **course**/**session**:

  * a meeting with a course is a _course meeting_;
  * a meeting with a user and no course is a _user meeting_;
  * a meeting with no course nor user is a _global meeting_.

## Registrants

A **registrant** is the registration of a local user to a meeting.

Users do not register themselves to meetings.

* They are registered to a course meeting by the course manager.
* They are registered to a user meeting by that user.
* They are registered automatically to the global meeting, when they enter it.

## Recordings

A **recording** is the list of files created during a past meeting instance.

Course meeting files can be copied to the course by the course manager.

# Required Zoom user account

Recordings and user registration are only available to paying Zoom customers.

For a non-paying Zoom user, this plugin still works but participants will join anonymously.

The user that starts the meeting will be identified as the zoom account that is define in the plugin. Socreate a generic account that works for all the users that start meetings.
