 Dokeos 1.8 INSTALLATION
*****************************************
Thank you for downloading Dokeos! This text will guide you through the
basics of installing Dokeos 1.8. Please read this fully
before proceeding with the installation.

This is only a short installation guide. We are writing a manual with more
info on installation, but this was not ready at the time of writing. When
ready, this manual will be accessible through the Dokeos documentation
page:
http://www.dokeos.com/documentation.php
You can also read the work in progress manual on our web writing area:

 1. Requirements
=================

Dokeos is a web application which requires some other software to function:
a web server, PHP, and the MySQL database server. These software packages
have to be installed on the computer where you will install Dokeos. 

You can install all these software packages separately, which often gives
the best results. However, beginning users who want to test Dokeos can use
a combination package that installs all these software packages in one
simple install. If you want to use a combination package, we recommend
Wamp (you also need the PHP4 add-on for WAMP) or XAMP.
WAMP5 website: http://www.wampserver.com/en/index.php
WAMP PHP4 add-on: http://www.wampserver.com/en/add-ons.php
XAMP: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/index.html

1.1. A web server

The Apache web server is recommended, and Dokeos is configured to use some
Apache security enhancements if possible. However, other web servers will
work too. For best security results, you need to have the Apache module
mod_rewrite activated. The mod_rewrite rules for Dokeos are read from a
.htaccess file in the courses folder, so Apache needs to allow this
(AllowOverride FileInfo in httpd.conf).

Download Apache web server:
http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

1.2. PHP

You need PHP version 4.3.2 or later (4.x versions), configured with the
following modules : mysql, zlib, preg, xml. PHP versions 5 or later are not
supported by Dokes yet. You need the ldap module too if you want to use ldap
with Dokeos. Most of the PHP4 compiled distributions are provided with these
modules. Their presence is also checked by the Dokeos install script. 

Download PHP:
http://www.php.net/downloads.php

Some users could meet problems if their PHP setting doesn't fit these ones:

short_open_tag = On
safe_mode = Off
magic_quotes_gpc = On
magic_quotes_runtime = Off

Past Dokeos versions required register_globals to be set to On. This is no
longer necessary, this can be set to Off and Dokeos will work fine.

BSD users:
these php libraries have to be included during php installation:
- php-mysql The mysql shared extension for php
- php-pcre The pcre shared extension for php
- php-session The session shared extension for php
- php-zlib The zlib shared extension for php
- (optional) php-ldap if you want to be able to use LDAP authentication


1.3. The MySQL database server

And a login/password allowing to administrate and create at least one
database. By default, Dokeos will create a new database for each course
created. It means your host should allow you to create and administrate
several databases. If you want to use Dokeos on a 'single database host'
you have to select this option during the installation. 

Download MySQL server:
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

Note:
It seems the backticks characters (`) inserted inside most of the Dokeos SQL
queries since version 1.3 don't work with MySQL versions before 3.23.6.

1.4. Permissions 
Furthermore, you need web Write access to web directory where Dokeos has
been moved or unzipped to. On a Windows machine locally, this is not a
problem. Remotely, you need to be allowed to CHMOD through FTP, telnet or
any means.

=======================================
 2. Installing a new version of Dokeos
=======================================

2.1. Download the Dokeos 1.8 install package (.zip for Windows users
or .tar.gz for all others) from the Dokeos download page:
http://www.dokeos.com/download.php

2.2. Unzip or untar the downloaded install package. Most current operating
systems can do this with a built-in graphical application, if this doesn't
work you can open a commandline, go to the download directory and type
tar -zxvf dokeos-1.8.tar.gz

2.3. Move by any means (FTP, SCP, local file copy) the contents of the
Dokeos install package to your website on your webserver (whether webroot
or subdirectory). Your webserver can also be your local computer. Be sure
to copy all the folders (archive, home, claroline, courses) as well as all
the .php files.

For Windows users: If you use e.g easyphp locally (http://www.easyphp.org),
just drag and drop the contents of the Dokeos install package into
C:\Program Files\easyphp\www\

2.4. The following files need to be readable and writeable for everyone:

dokeos/main/inc/conf/claro_main.conf.php (if present)
dokeos/home/*.html

On Linux, Mac OS X and BSD operating systems you can use the CHMOD 666
command for this. In Windows, you may need to check the properties of
the folders.

NOTE:
Do not modify the home_*.html files directly. Instead, choose "Configure
the homepage" in the Dokeos administration section.

2.5. The following directories need to be readable, writeable and executable
for everyone:

dokeos/main/inc/conf/
dokeos/main/garbage/
dokeos/main/upload/
dokeos/archive/
dokeos/courses/
dokeos/home/

On Linux, Mac OS X and BSD operating systems you can use the CHMOD 777
command for this. In Windows, you may need to check the properties of
the folders.

2.6. Open a web browser and go to 
http://www.yourserver.org/yoursite/dokeos/index.php

For Windows users locally, with e.g easyphp or another combination package,
open http://localhost/dokeos/index.php

2.7. Click on the install button and follow instructions. Windows: with
combination packages like easyphp, out of the box, login and password for
MySQL should probably remain empty.

2.8. Security after installation

Protect your configuration file
make sure no one can overwrite it. You can find the config file in (dokeos
folder)/main/inc/conf/claro_main.conf.php. Make it read-only
(windows/xwindows: right-click the file to edit the properties.
linux/bsd/macosx: use the chmod 444 command).

Protect your installation folder
if the (dokeos folder)/main/install folder is still accessible,
someone could install over your existing version (you could lose your data
that way). Move the folder somewhere out of the web directories so it is
not accessible, change its name, or edit its properties so no one can read
or execute it.

===============================================
 3. Upgrading from a previous version of Dokeos
===============================================

Before upgrading we heavily recommend you do a full backup of the previous Claroline or Dokeos directories and databases. If you are unsure how to achieve this please ask your hosting provider for advice.

3.1. Download the Dokeos 1.8 install package (.zip for Windows users
or .tar.gz for all others) from the Dokeos download page:
http://www.dokeos.com/download.php

3.2. Unzip or untar the downloaded install package. Most current operating systems can do this with a built-in graphical application, if this doesn't work you can open a commandline, go to the download directory and type tar -zxvf dokeos-1.6.beta.tar.gz

3.3. Move the Dokeos directory to a different path from the previous version

WARNING:
Do not delete the previous Dokeos installation directory before installing the new one. When the update is successfully finished, you can remove the old path.

TIP:
If you want Dokeos 1.8 to be installed in the same directory as the previous version :

move the old directory to a new location (e.g. move dokeos/ to dokeos_old/)
uncompress Dokeos 1.8 to the old version directory (e.g. uncompress Dokeos 1.6 to dokeos/)
go to next step

3.4. The following files need to be readable and writeable for everyone:

dokeos/main/inc/conf/claro_main.conf.php (if present)
dokeos/home/*.html

On Linux, Mac OS X and BSD operating systems you can use the CHMOD 666 command for this. In Windows, you may need to check the properties of the folders.

NOTE:
Do not modify the home_*.html files directly. Instead, choose "Configure the homepage" in the Dokeos administration section.

3.5. The following directories need to be readable, writeable and executable for everyone:

dokeos/main/inc/conf/
dokeos/main/garbage/
dokeos/main/upload/
dokeos/archive/
dokeos/courses/
dokeos/home/

On Linux, Mac OS X and BSD operating systems you can use the CHMOD 777 command for this. In Windows, you may need to check the properties of the folders.
3.6. Open a web browser and go to http://www.yourserver.org/yoursite/dokeos/index.php Windows locally, with e.g easyphp or another combination package, open: http://localhost/dokeos/index.php

3.7. Click on the install button, then click on "Update from Dokeos 1.5 | 1.5.4 | 1.5.5" and follow the instructions.

3.8. This part is optional!
Since after version 1.5.5, the following tables in the dokeos_main database can be removed when upgrading from a 1.5.5 version or lower, provided that you don't use them for a customisation of your Dokeos system:

`todo`
`pma_bookmark`
`pma_column_comments`
`pma_pdf_pages`
`pma_relation`
`pma_table_coords`
`pma_table_info`
These tables can be removed by connecting to the database as the Dokeos user and executing this query: DROP TABLE dokeos_main.my_table; where dokeos_main is the main dokeos database name and my_table is each of the preceding tables (repeat query for each) 

A clean-up of the useless fields has also influenced some code: The main_db.cours.cours_id has been removed, as all references to that field throughout the official Dokeos code. The course code (literal) is used instead. Please update your custom code if any. 

Under the same circumstances as tables removal, the following fields can be removed if not used by your code, using a query similar to: ALTER TABLE database.table drop column abc where database is the database name (dokeos_main? or code of a course) table is the table name (cours?) abc is the name of the field to drop You can thus drop the following fields:
`_dokeos_main_`.`cours`.`versionDb`
`_dokeos_main_`.`cours`.`versionClaro`
`_dokeos_main_`.`cours`.`cahier_charges`
`_dokeos_main_`.`faculte`.`bc` 
# the table `faculte` has been renamed to `course_category` since 1.6
`_cours_`.`announcement`.`code_cours`
`_cours_`.`course_description`.`upDate`

===========================
 4. Troubleshooting
===========================

In the future we will also provide instructions on how to do a "manual"
install of Dokeos, by creating the database tables yourself. If you have
any problems, go to the Dokeos website and ask a question on our support
forum. Please read the previous messages first to see if there is already
an answer to your question. We also maintain a list of Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ).

===========================
 5. Administration section
===========================

To access the Dokeos administration section, open browser, go to your Dokeos adress and log in with the admin user. Then you will see a "Platform admin section" link in the header of the web page.

===========================
 6. LDAP
===========================

This part is optional, only organisations with an LDAP server will need to read this.
An LDAP module is already provided in Dokeos, but it has to be configured to make it work.

6.0. Compiling
Linux servers: It's possible that you have to recompile php with ldap support.
Newer distributions also allow downloading rpms for additional packages.

6.1. Activating
In main/inc/conf/claro_main.conf.php, around line 90, you see
//for new login module
//uncomment these to activate ldap
//$extAuthSource['ldap']['login'] = "./main/auth/ldap/login.php";
//$extAuthSource['ldap']['newUser'] = "./main/auth/ldap/newUser.php";

remove the // from the last two lines to activate LDAP.

6.2. Settings
Ask the LDAP server admin for the settings:
- ldap server name
- ldap server port (usually 389)
- ldap dc
You must enter these in
main/auth/ldap/ldap_var.inc.php

//parameters for LDAP module
$usesLDAP						=	TRUE;
$usesCurriculum					=	FALSE;
$ldaphost = "myldapserver.com";  // your ldap server
$ldapport = 389;                 // your ldap server's port number
$ldapDc = "dc=xx, dc=yy, dc=zz"; //domain

6.3. Teacher/student status
If you wish, you can give teacher/student status to dokeos users according to settings in the ldap server.
This is not a standard field however, so you'll have to change some code.
main/auth/ldap/ldap_var.inc.php
around line 189,	function putUserInfoInClaroline ($login, $infoArray)
if (<your criterium>)
{
	$statut = STUDENT;
}
else
{
	$statut = COURSEMANAGER;
}

If this seems too difficult, the simplest solution is to just put
$statut = STUDENT;
and give course manager rights through the admin panel.

6.4. Some LDAP servers do not support anonymous use of the directory services.
In this case, you need code that binds with a name and password - this code has already been provided,
just ask on a forum or email for this.
