<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Watermark portal images are now saved in the main/default_course_document/images/ folder. If you used portal-wide watermarks before, you might need to upload the watermark image again.</li>
  <li>A style-specific switch had been added in 1.8.8.2, which improved the appearance of older style but went against MVC's principles and broke copies of Chamilo-based styles. This switch has been removed, which may lead to the breadcrumb in non-chamilo-based styles to appear as less attractive, but keeps the MVC model safe so anyone can modify the appearance safely from the CSS. This might require very little cosmetic changes from you (in your style's default.css file), but we believe it's for the best.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Third-Party Libraries updates</h3>
<ul>    
    <li>Chozen library added (select tag improved) #3740</li>
    <li>Jquery updated to version 1.6.2</li>

<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed several limited-risk potential XSS.</li>
  <li>For other changes see 1.8.8 changelog below</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Groups (admin only): When a user is subscribed in a Course through a Group and he's also subscribed in the same Course (tradional way), when removing the user from the Group, the user will be also removed from the Course in both levels.</li>

  <li>If you used split users directories before v1.8.8 in combination with the "My files" feature (if it existed at all at that point), you will probably have a problem now, as the code in the previous version was wrong and was saving the personal portfolio file in another directory than the user's. Sorry about that. If you need professional assistance, see the http://www.chamilo.org/ website under support -> professional support for official providers who could help you. And don't forget to keep a backup. If you don't understand a thing about what I'm talking about, you are probable not concerned by this bug, so don't worry too much.</li>
  <li>Document tool: when moving an HTML file using the "move" funcionality, images, videos and any incrusted file in that HTML will not be moved automatically see #1278 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed more than 10 potential low-impact security issues in wiki (see <a href="http://support.chamilo.org/projects/chamilo-18/wiki/Security_issues">our security page</a> for details).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Groups (admin only): When a user is subscribed in a Course through a Group and he's also subscribed in the same Course (tradional way), when removing the user from the Group, the user will be also removed from the Course in both levels.</li>
  <li>Changed "givenname" for "cn" in LDAP queries. This might break some of the previous implementations of this plugin</li>
  <li>If you used split users directories before v1.8.8 in combination with the "My files" feature (if it existed at all at that point), you will probably have a problem now, as the code in the previous version was wrong and was saving the personal portfolio file in another directory than the user's. Sorry about that. If you need professional assistance, see the http://www.chamilo.org/ website under support -> professional support for official providers who could help you. And don't forget to keep a backup. If you don't understand a thing about what I'm talking about, you are probable not concerned by this bug, so don't worry too much.</li>
  <li>For some reason, we have been reported unsuccessful migrations from 1.8.7 to 1.8.7.1 whereby the course_rel_user table was not integrally copied. We recommend keeping your database backup until you're sure every student/course relationship was copied (comparing the lines in the table before and after migration might help you)</li>     
  <li>Document tool: when moving an HTML file using the "move" funcionality, images, videos and any incrusted file in that HTML will not be moved automatically see #1278 </li>
<li>Hotpotatoes: When taking a Hotpotato exam added to Chamilo there is a javascript error, this bug can be only reproduced using Google Chrome see #3332</li>

</ul>
<h3>Deprecated features</h3>
<p>
In order to maintain a sufficient level of stability and push innovation 
forward, we have decided to officially drop support for specific features. 
This doesn't mean that they won't work anymore, but it indicates that they 
will cease being improved slowly, until we do not feel anyone is using them, 
at which point (probably several years afterwards) we will remove them from 
the code.<br />
If you feel like a feature listed here is of major importance to you, you can 
either take the maintenance of this feature officially in charge by contacting 
us at info@chamilo.org or you can hire the services of one of our official 
providers (see our website, <i>Support</i> tab).
</p>  
<ul>
  <li>Legacy classes - There is now new code to combine classes with the 
  sessions feature or with the courses in a cleaner, more efficient way. We 
  invite you to switch to session mode and rebuild your classes through the 
  new "Class" option in the sessions block and let us know how that works our 
  for you.</li>
  <li>Virtual courses - This feature has long been deprecated and we doubt any 
  of our user is using it. If you are, please find another mechanism that suits 
  your needs for that.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deprecated files</h3>
<ul>
  <li>main/garbage/ directory</li>
  <li>main/app_share/ was previously the experimental directory for a screen sharing application never deeply implemented. Use BigBlueButton instead, now.
</ul>

<h3>CSS changes</h3>
<ul>  
  <li>CSS factorization - putting all common CSS to main/css/base.css see #3163</li>
  <li>CSS factorization - putting all common CSS classic styles into main/css/base_classic.css see #3163</li>
  <li>CSS factorization - putting all common CSS chamilo_XXX styles into main/css/base_chamilo.css see #3163</li>
  <li>Improving breadcrumb for chamilo_XXX styles, this feature is not enabled for other themes</li>
  <li>Thickbox UI was changed to improved usability</li>
</ul>

<h1>Chamilo 1.8.7 - Istanbul</h1>


<h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
<p>Chamilo 1.8.7 is a major&nbsp;release including a lot of new features, mostly focused on social network, the handling of sessions (which will help many educational institutions, public or private, to manage their contents in a more flexible way) and visual style, and a few important bugfixes. It lays the first stable stone in the Chamilo software project. This version is the first one to <b>highly recommend PHP 5.2</b> or superior, and <b>require PHP 5.1</b> or higher.<br />Also, this version of Chamilo will automatically convert all your data to UTF-8, which will make it more difficult to migrate from Dokeos versions higher than 1.8.6.1</p>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Full UTF-8 support has been implemented (Feature #272)<ul>
    <li>UTF-8 becomes recommended system encoding to be used. It is also recommended that HTML-documents created with external tools be UTF-8 encoded.</li>
    <li>For newly installed systems: UTF-8 is the default value of the administrator's setting "Character set". Database tables will now be storing UTF-8 encoded text.</li>
    <li>For upgraded systems: The upgrade procedure automatically changes the character set to UTF-8. During upgrade database tables are converted to UTF-8 and the corresponding changes to text fields are applied. Conversion to UTF-8 of HTML documents stored in the file system is not performed, this is not mandatory.</li>

<h1>Dokeos 1.8.6.1 - August 2009</h1>

<h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
<p>Dokeos 1.8.6.1 is a minor&nbsp;release including just a few new features, mostly focused on internationalization, and several bugfixes.</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented new sub-language feature by which language terms redefinition becomes possible through the admin section (FS#4321)</li>
  <li>Admin: Terms and conditions added DT#4320</li>
  <li>Improvements in document tool, allow seeing glossary terms (FS#4337)</li>
  <li>Small improvements in SCORM export(FS#4300)</li>
  <li>At the beginning of the installation script, added an imperative check for PHP 5 has been added. (FS#4296)</li>
  <li>When the system Dokeos is switched into "Test server" mode, a clickable indicator appears in the footer. This indicator is visible by platform administrators only. (FS#4341)</li>
  <li>A transliteration function has been added. Currently, it is used in uploading files. Files with non-English names get names that contain ASCII letters only, remaining readable in the corresponding language. Rationale: The PHP5 run-time environment does not manage file name encodings, adding such a non-native feature involves too much work. For avoiding character encoding problems, transliteration of file names is the possible solution. (FS#306)</li>
  <li>An internationalization option has been added for improving sorting in arbitrary language. When the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php" target="_blank">intl</a> php-extension has been installed, various sorting routines exploit it for better sorting. Rationale: The PHP5 run-time environment does not provide native and reliable way of sorting UTF-8 strings. (FS#306)</li>
  <li>Installation script: The page about system requilements has been updated. Also, at the very beginning, a check has been added whether the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php" target="_blank">mbstring</a> php-extension is installed - see <a href="http://dokeos.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=29548" target="_blank">the related forum topic</a>. (FS#306)</li>
  <li>A new php-based configuration for the online editor has been implemented, see <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/myconfig.php</i>. Also, toolbar definitions have been split in separate php-files within the directory <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/toolbars/</i> . Customization of the editor is more convenient and flexible now. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: A upgrade from FCKEditor 2.6.4 to <strong>FCKEditor 2.6.4.1</strong> has been implemented. (FS#4383)</li>
  <li>Online editor: Blocking copy/paste for trainees has been added. The feature is configurable through editing the toolbar definition files within the directory <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/toolbars/</i> . (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: Preview tabs have been added to the dialogs for inserting video, flv-video, and YouTube video. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: The <strong>audio</strong> plugin has been activated by default as an implementation of the "Insert audio / Audio properties" dialog. This new plugin is intended to replace the "MP3" plugin. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: The simple file manager, the advanced file manager and the image manager have been integrated by default with the editor's dialog system. Thus, they work faster and in a more secure way. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: Configuration of the <strong>mimetex</strong> plugin has been reworked to gain simplicity. The procedure for configuration has been updated, see <a href="http://www.dokeos.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=29594" target="_blank">the related forum topic</a>. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: A new <strong>asciimath</strong> plugin for inserting mathematical formulas has been added. It is based on the <a href="http://mathcs.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html" target="_blank">ASCIIMathML.js</a> library. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Social: Added possibility to define RSS feeds inside personal page of social network (need to define an 'rssfeeds' extra user text field)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Debugging</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Online editor: Several known bug-fixes from FCKEditor 2.6.5 SVN have been implemented, tickets <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/1537" target="_blank">#1537</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2156" target="_blank">#2156</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2689" target="_blank">#2689</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2821" target="_blank">#2821</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2856" target="_blank">#2856</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2874" target="_blank">#2874</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2915" target="_blank">#2915</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3120" target="_blank">#3120</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3181" target="_blank">#3181</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3427" target="_blank">#3427</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3429" target="_blank">#3429</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3439" target="_blank">#3439</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3446" target="_blank">#3446</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3481" target="_blank">#3481</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3677" target="_blank">#3677</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3818" target="_blank">#3818</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3880" target="_blank">#3880</a>, <a href="http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/3925" target="_blank">#3925</a>. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: The toolbar icons have been upgraded to those from FCKEditor 3.0. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>A solution has been implemented for fixing the <a href="http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-529" target="_blank">"__flash__removeCallback" bug</a>, which affects the media player on Internet Explorer browser. (FS#4378 and FS#2867)</li>
