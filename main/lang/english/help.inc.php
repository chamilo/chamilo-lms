Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in th first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and is not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determinewhether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>";

$langDocContent = "<p>The Documents tool allows you to organise files just like you do on your pc/laptop. </p><p>You can create simple web pages ('Create a document') or upload files of any type (HTML, Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Acrobat, Flash, Quicktime, etc.). Remember, of course, that your learners will need to have the appropriate software to open and run these files. Some file types can contain viruses; be careful not to upload virus-contaminated files, unless your portal admin has installed server side anti=virus software.  It is, in any case, a worthwhile precaution to check documents with antivirus software before uploading them.</p><p>Documents are presented in alphabetical order.<br><br><b>Tip : </b>If you want to present them in a different order, number them (e.g. 01, 02, 03...) Or use the Learning Path to present a sophisticated Table of Contents. Note that once your documents are uploaded, you may decide to hide the documents area and show only one link on the Homepage (using the links tool) or a Learning Path containing some documents from your Documents area.</p><p><H4>Create a document</H4><p>Select Create a document > Give it a title (no spaces, no accents) > type your text > Use the buttons in the wysiwyg (What You See Is What You Get) editor to input information, tables, styles etc. To create effective web pages, you need to become familiar with three key functions: Links, Images and Tables. Be aware that web pages offer less layout options than e.g. Ms-Word pages. Note also that as well as creating a document from scratch in the editor, you can also cut and paste existing content from a web page or a Word document. This is an easy and quick way to import content into your Chamilo course.</p><ul><li><b>To add a link</b>, you need to copy the URL of the target page. We suggest you open two browser windows/tabs simultaneously, one with your Chamilo course and the other to browse the web. Once you find the page you are looking for (note that this page can be inside your Chamilo course), copy its URL (CTRL+C or APPLE+C), go back to the page editor, select the word to be the link, click on the small chain icon, paste the URL of your target in the popup window and submit. Once your page is saved, test the link to check it opens the target. You can decide in the Link popup menu whether the link will create a new page/tab or replace your Chamilo page in the same window.</li><li><b>To add an image</b>, the process is the same as for the link feature : browse the web in a second window, find the image (if the image is inside your course's documents area, copy its URL (CTRL+C or APPLE+C in the URL bar after selecting the whole URL) then go back to your web page editor, position your mouse where you want your image to appear, then click on the small tree icon and copy the URL of the target image into the URL field, preview and submit. Note that in web pages, you cannot redimension your images as in a PowerPoint presentation, neither can you re-locate the image anywhere in the page.</li><li><b>To add a table</b>, position your mouse in the field where you want the table to appear, then select the table icon in the Wysiwyg editor menu, decide on the number of columns and lines you need and submit. To get nice tables, we suggest that you choose the following values : border=1, cellspacing=0, cellpadding=4. Note that you will not be allowed to redimension your table or add lines or columns to it after its creation (sorry about this, it is just an online editor, not a word processor yet!).</li></ul><h4>Upload a document</h4><ul>  <li>Select the file on your computer using the Browse button <input type=submit value=Browse name=submit2>\ton the right of your screen.</li>\t\t<li>\t\t\tLaunch the upload with the Upload Button <input type=submit value=Upload name=submit2>.\t\t</li>\t\t<li>\t\t\tCheck the checkbox under the Upload button if your document is zip file or a so-called <b>SCORM package</b>.

Your sequence can be <i>suggestive</i> (simply displaying steps one after the other) or <i>prescriptive</i> (involving pre-requisites so that learners are required to follow steps in a particular order ).</p><p><b>How do I create my own Learning Path (Course)?</b></p><p>Proceed to the 'Learning Path' section.  There you can create as many courses/paths as you wish by clicking the <i>Create a new course</i> tool. You will need to choose a name for the course/path (e.g. <i>Unit 1</i> if you plan to create several units within the overall course). To begin with, the course is empty, waiting for you to add sections and learning objects to it.<br>If you set a course to Visible, it will appear as a new tool on the course homepage. This makes it easier and clearer for students to access.</p><p><b>What learning objects can I add?</b></p><p>All Chamilo tools, activities and content that you consider useful and relevant to yourcourse can be added :<br><ul><li>Separate documents (texts, pictures, Office docs, ...)</li><li>Forums as a whole</li><li>Topics</li><li>Links</li><li>Chamilo Tests</li><li>HotPotatoes Tests<br />(note :tests made invisible on the homepage, but included in a path, become visible for learners onl as they work throught the course.)</li><li>Assignments</li><li>External links</li></ul></p><p><b>Other features</b></p><p>Learners can be asked to follow your course in a given order, as you can set <u>prerequisites</u>. This means for example thatlearners cannot go to e.g. Quiz 2 until they have read e.g. Document 1. All learning objects have a status:<i>completed</i> or <i>incomplete</i>, so the progress of learners is clearly reported.</p><p>If you alter the original title of a learning object, the new name will appear inthe course, but the original title will not be deleted. So if you want test8.doc to appear as 'Final Exam' in the path, you do not have to rename the file, you can use the new title in the path. It is also useful to give new titles to links which are too long.</p><p>When you're finished, don't forget to check Display mode, (showing, as in learner view, the table of contents on the left and the learning objects on the right,one at a time.)</p><br><p><b>What is a SCORM course and how do I import one?</b></p><p>The learning path tool allows you to upload SCORM compliant courses.</p><p>SCORM  (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) is a public standard followed by major e-Learning companies like NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft, etc. They act at three levels:</p><ul><li><b>Economy</b> : SCORM renders whole courses or small content units reusable on different Learning Management Systems (LMS) through the separation of content and context,</li><li><b>Pedagogy</b> : SCORM integrates the notion ofpre-requisite or <i>sequencing</i> (<i>e.g. </i>\"Youcannot go to chapter 2 before passing Quiz 1\"),</li><li><b>Technology</b> : SCORM generates a table of contents as an abstraction layer situated outside content and outside the LMS. It helps content and the LMS to communicate with each other. Mainly communicated are <i>bookmarks</i>(\"Where is John in thecourse?\"), <i>scoring</i> (\"How did John pass the test?\") and <i>time</i> (\"How muchtime did John spent in chapter 1?\").</li></ul><b>How can I create a SCORM compliant learning path?</b><br><br>The obvious way is to use the Chamilo Authoring tool. However, you may prefer to create complete SCORM compliant websites locally on your own computer before uploading it onto your Chamilo platform. In this case, we recommend the use of a sophisticated tool like Lectora®, eXe Learning® or Reload®<br></p><p>";

You can edit every link to re-assign it to a new category (you will need to create this category first).</p><p>The Description field can be used to provide advance-information on the target web pages but also to describe what you expect the student to do with the link. If, for instance, you point to a website on Aristotle, the description field may ask the student to study the difference between synthesis and analysis.";
$langMycoursesContent = "<p> As soon as you log in to the system, you will be taken to your own main  page.

$langChatContent = "<p>The Chat tool allows you to chat 'live' with your students in real time. </p> In contrast to most commercial chat tools, the chat in Chamilo is web based and does not require any additional install (e.g.  MSN® Yahoo Messenger®. Skype® etc.) A key advantage of this solution is therefore it's immediate availablilty for students, allowing chat to be easily integrated into the course. Moreover, the Chamilo chat tool will automatically archive discussions and save them for ready access later via the Documents tool. (Be warned that the message may take from 1 to 5 seconds to refresh with each exchange - this doesn't mean anything is wrong!!). </p> If learners have uploaded a profile picture it will appear (reduced in size) in the left column -  otherwise, it will show a default image. </p> It is the responsibility of the teacher to delete threads whenever he/she deems relevant. </p> <b>Educational Use</b> <p>Adding Chat to your course is not always a good idea. To make best use of this tool, you need to ensure discussions remains focussed on course content. You might, for example, decide to keep the chat facility hidden until it is time for a 'formal' scheduled session. That way,while the freedom of discussions may admittedly be curbed, you are able to better guarantee thatsuch live meetings will be beneficial .</p>";

Making all files visible is useful when, for instance, you want to ask students to share opinions on each others papers, or when you want to give them experience in publishing texts globally. Keep files invisible if, for example, you want ask everybody the same question but to avoid 'cheating'. Making the documents invisible will also allow you to have some form of control over when a document is available to all the other students. </p><p>If you want  students to hand in a document for grading you're best, from within the tool, to assign submissions to a folder.</p> <p>You can use the the tool to set deadlines and instructions for delivery, as well as a maximum grade/score.</p>";

Reporting provides two levels of information:<ul><li><b>Global</b>: How many students have accessed the course?

This way you keep control of who is registered while avoiding the administrative hassle of registering them yourself.</p>(Note - some organizations prefer not to use this method and opt to centralise registration. In this case, participants cannot enrol in your course at all, even if you, as a trainer / teacher, wish to give them access. To check this, look at the home page of your campus (as opposed to your course homepage) to see if the 'Register' link is present.) </p> <p>At the bottom of the page, you can back up the course and delete it. Backup will create a file on the server and allow you to copy it on your own Hard Disk locally so that there will be two backups each in different places. If you back up a course and then delete it you will not be be able to restore it yourself, but the system administrator can do this for you if you give him/her the code of your training.
