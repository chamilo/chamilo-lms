In contrast to e-mail, a forum is for public, or semi-public, group discussion. </p>To use the Chamilo forum, members can simply use their browser - they do not require any distinct client software. </p>To organize forums, click on the Forums tool. Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>"

The change of this option will not affect the directories structure on disk, but will affect the behaviour of the Chamilo code, so if you change this option, you have to create the new directories and move the existing directories by yourself on te server. Be aware that when creating and moving those directories, you will have to move the directories of users 1 to 9 into subdirectories of the same name.

msgid "OpenID eliminates the need for multiple logins across different websites, simplifying your online experience. You get to choose the OpenID Provider that best meets your needs and most importantly that you trust. At the same time, your OpenID can stay with you, no matter which Provider you move to. And best of all, the OpenID technology is not proprietary and is completely free.For businesses, this means a lower cost of password and account management, while drawing new web traffic. OpenID lowers user frustration by letting users have control of their login.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://openid.net/what/\">Read on...</a>"

Discussions are organized hierarchically according to the following structure: </ p><b> Category> Forum> Topic> Post</ b> </ p> To ensure members can participate in the forum tidily and effectively, it is essential in the first instance to create categories and forums; it's then up to the participants to create topics and posts. By default, the forum contains a single (public) category, an example topic and an example post. You can add forums to the category,  change its title or create other categories within which you could then create new forums. (Don't confuse categories and forums, and remember that a category that contains no forum is useless and is not displayed.)</p>\n<p>The forum description might include a list of its members, a definition of its purpose, a target a task, a theme etc.</p><p>Group forums should not be created via the Forum tool but instead via the Groups tool, where you can determine whether your group forums should be private or public, at the same time providing a location for sharing groups of documents.</p><b> Teaching Tips</ b></ p> A learning forum is not quite the same as the forums you are used to seeing on the internet. For one thing, it is not possible for learners to alter their posts once they have been published as the course is logically archived to allow tracking of what has been said in the past. Furthermore, Chamilo forums allow for specific uses  relevant to teaching. For example, some teachers/trainers publish corrections directly within forums in the following way: <li> A learner is asked to post a report directly into the forum, </ li> The teacher corrects it by clicking Edit (yellow pencil) and marking it using the graphics editor (color, underlining, etc.) </ li> Finally, other learners benefit from viewing the corrections was made on the production of one of of them, </ li> Note that the same principle can be applied between learners, but will require his copying/pasting the message of his fellow student because students / trainees can not edit one another's posts. <. li> </ ul>"

msgid "The Course tool supports two approaches :<ul><li>Create a new course (allowing you to author your own content)</li><li>Import SCORM course</li></ul><img src=\"../img/path_help.gif\"><p><b>What is a Learning Path?</b></p><p>A Learning Path allows for the presentation of a sequence of learning experiences or activities arranged in distinct sections (in this sense, the Learning Path is what distinguishes a 'course' from a mere repository of random documents). It can be content-based (serving as a table of contents) or activities-based, serving as an agenda or program of action necessary to understand and apply a particular area of knowledge or skill.</p><p>In addition to being  structured, a Learning Path can also be <i>sequential</i>, meaning that the completion of certain steps constitute pre-requisites for accessing others (i.e. 'you cannot go to learning object 2 before learning object 1'). Your sequence can be <i>suggestive</i> (simply displaying steps one after the other) or <i>prescriptive</i> (involving pre-requisites so that learners are required to follow steps in a particular order).</p><p><b>How do I create my own Learning Path (Course)?</b></p><p>Proceed to the 'Learning Path' section.  There you can create as many courses/paths as you wish by clicking the <i>Create a new course</i> tool. You will need to choose a name for the course/path (e.g. <i>Unit 1</i> if you plan to create several units within the overall course). To begin with, the course is empty, waiting for you to add sections and learning objects to it.<br>If you set a course to Visible, it will appear as a new tool on the course homepage. This makes it easier and clearer for students to access.</p><p><b>What learning objects can I add?</b></p><p>All Chamilo tools, activities and content that you consider useful and relevant to your course can be added :<br><ul><li>Separate documents (texts, pictures, Office docs, ...)</li><li>Forums as a whole</li><li>Topics</li><li>Links</li><li>Chamilo Tests</li><li>HotPotatoes Tests<br />(note :tests made invisible on the homepage, but included in a path, become visible for learners only as they work through the course.)</li><li>Assignments</li><li>External links</li></ul></p><p><b>Other features</b></p><p>Learners can be asked to follow your course in a given order, as you can set <u>pre-requisites</u>. This means for example that learners cannot go to e.g. Quiz 2 until they have read e.g. Document 1.

LP dapat berupa content-based (tampak seperti daftar isi) atau activities-based, tampak seperti agenda program kerja yang dibutuhkan untuk mengerti suatu pengetahuan (knowledge/know-how).</p><p>Disamping terstruktur, LP dapat juga berupa sekuen. Maksudnya beberapalangkah akan membentuk sustu syarat bagi langkah lainnya ('anda tidak dapat ke langkah2 jika belum melewati langkah1'). Sekuen dapat bersifat sugestif (anda menampilkan suatu langkah setelah langkah sebelumnya) atau imperatif (anda menambhakan parasyarat sehingga user dipaksa mengikuti sekuen). </p> <p><b>Bagaimana membuat sendiri Learning Path ?</b></p> <p> Langkah pertama masuk ke bagian Learning Path Builder. Pada layar LP, terdapat link untuk itu. Disini anda dapat membuat banyak paths dengan meng-klik<i>Tambah Learning Path Baru</i>. Tetapi LP tsb masih kosong hingga anda menambahkan modul dan step kepadanya.<br>Jika anda membuat suatu path nampak (visible), LP tsb akan tampil sebagai tool baru pada homepage Mata Kuliah anda. Denagn cara ini pengaksesannya menjadi lebih mudah.</p> <p> <b>Langkah-lagkah (steps) apa saja untuk LP ini? (item-item apa saja yang dapat ditambahkan?)</b></p> <p>Semua Tool Chamilo, kegiatan atau konten/isi yang anda anggap berguna dan berhubungan dapat ditambahkan :<br><ul> <li>Item Agenda</li> <li>Dokumen terpisah (text, gambar, dokumen office, dll.)</li> <li>Item Pengumuman</li> <li>Forum secara keseluruhan</li> <li>Topik-topik</li> <li>Pesan topik individu</li> <li>Link</li> <li>Latihan Chamilo</li> <li>HotPotatoes Tests <br>(note : latihan/test yang tersembunyi yang anda masukkanke LP, menjadi nampak bagi siswa, tetapi hanya pada tool LP)</li> <li>HAlaman Tugas</li> <li>Halaman Dropbox</li> <li>Link External, yang mengacu pada sumber di luar system Chamilo anda</li></ul> </p> <p><b> Fitur-fitur lain Learning Path</b> </p> <p> Siswa dapat diminta mengikuti (membaca) LP anda dalam urutan yang ditentukan, seperti anda menseting<u>persyaratan</u> dalam LP. Maksudnya, sebagai contoh siswa tidak dapat ke Quiz 2 sebelum membaca Dokumen 1.  Semua item memiliki status : tuntas atau belum tuntas, sehingga perkembangan siswa terpantau. </p><p> Jika anda mengubah judul asli suatu langkah, judul baru akan tampil di LP tersebut, tetapi judul asli tidak dihapus. Sehingga jika anda menginginkan test8.doc tampil sebagai 'Ujian Akhir di LP, anda tidak harus menggati nama/rename file, anda dapat menggunakan judul baru di LP tersebut. Sangat berguna juga untuk memberi judul baru ke link jika terlalu panjang. </p><p> Jika selesai, jangan lupa memeriksa tampilan situs pada jendela siswa, dimana daftar isi tampil di kiri dan langkah/steps biasanya di kanan , satu demi satu. </p><br><p><b> Apa yang dimaksud dengan Learning path berformat Scorm atau IMS dan bagaimana cara mengupload/import-nya?</b> </p> <p>Tool LP memungkin kita untuk meng-upload isi mata kuliah berformat SCORM dan IMS.</p> <p>SCORM (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) merupakan standar umum untuk mengikuti pemain utama e-Learning seperti NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft, dll. dan berlaku dalam 3 tingkatan : </p> <ul> <li><b>Economy</b> : Scorm memungkin kan keseluruhan mata kuliah atau unit isi/konten kecil dapat digunakan kembali/reusable pada Learning Management Systems (LMS) lain melalui pemisahan isi/content dan konteks/context,</li> <li><b>Pedagogy</b> : Scorm mengintegrasikan ide prasyarat/pre-requisite atau <i>urut-urutan/sequencing</i> (<i>misal </i>\"Anda tidak dapat pergi ke Bab 2 sebelum lulus Quiz 1\"),</li> <li><b>Technology</b> : Scorm membuat daftar isi sebagai lapisan abstraksi/abstraction layer berada di luar isi/kontendan diluar LMS tsb. Ini membantu konten dan LMS berkomunikasi satu sama lain. Apa yang dikomunikasikan terutama <i>bookmarks </i>(\"Diposisi mana si Hisyam pada mata kuliah ini?\"), <i>pen-skor-an</i> (\"Bagaimana nilai test Hisyam ?\") and <i>waktu</i> (\"Berapa waktu yang digunakan Hisyam pada Bab 1?\").</li> </ul> <b>Bagaimana membuat  suatu SCORM compliant learning path?</b><br> <br> Cara alami termudah adalah dengan menggunakan Chamilo Learning Path Builder.

msgid "<p>Getting proper feedback on your courses is extremely important. You will find the dedicated Survey tool invaluable for getting effective feedback from users. </p> <p><b>Creating a new survey</b></p> <p> Click on the link 'Create a new survey' and fill in the fields 'Survey code' and 'Survey title'. With the help of the calendar, you can control the duration of your survey. There's no need to keep it open for a whole year; allow access for a few days at the end of the course program. Filling in the text fields 'Survey introduction' and 'Survey thanks' is also good practice; this will add clarity and a certain friendliness to your survey.</p> <p><b>Adding questions to the survey</b></p> <p>Once the survey outline is created, it is up to you to create the questions. The 'Survey' tool has many question types: open/closed questions, percentage, QCM, multiple responses... You should certainly find everything you need for your (ever increasing) feedback requirements.</p>  <p><b>Previewing the survey</b></p><p>Once you have created questions, you may want to check what the survey will look like to learners. Click on the 'Preview' icon and the preview screen will show you exactly this.</p> <p><b>Publishing the survey</b></p> <p>Happy with the preview? Any modifications to be made? No? Then click on the icon 'Publish survey' to send the survey to the selected list of recipients. As with creating groups, use the list 'Users of this course' on the left and the one for 'receivers' on its right to arrange this. Next, fill in the e-mail subject 'Title of the e-mail' and the content, 'Text of the e-mail'. Potential surveyees will be alerted by e-mail of the availability of a survey. Think carefully about  the wording of the e-mail  because it will play a big part in motivating users to take the survey.</p>  <p><b>Survey reports</b></p> Analysing surveys is a tedious task. The survey Reporting tool will help with analysis as it sorts reports according to question, user, comparisons etc...  <p><b>Managing surveys</b></p> When managing surveys you will see some new icons, apart from the usual 'Edit' and 'Delete' options. You can preview, publish and keep track of your surveys and responses using these.</p>"
