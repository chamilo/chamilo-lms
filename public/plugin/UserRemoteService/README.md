User Remote Service Plugin
==========================

Appends site-specific iframe-targeted user-identifying links to the menu bar.
You can also hide the link from the menu and use the redirect link to use it as a link in a course.

After activation, configure a __salt__ then select region __menu_administrator__.

In the __Administration__ menu, in block __Plugins__,
you will find a link __User Remote Services__ to manage the services in the main menu (title and URL) and also get the redirect URL to use in a course.
