Student Follow Up plugin
===

This plugin builds the basic pieces of a Student Information System 
to enable teachers to give the right user experience to long-term students (and generally 
life-long learners) while studying.
 
This means teachers can pass along information to their pears about the difficulties a student
has in studying some topics or some challenges they face that might affect their learning.

This plugin is in an early stage of development and should later (once mainstreamed) be fully
 integrated into Chamilo.
 
*Prior to installing/uninstalling this plugin, you will need to make sure the src/Chamilo/PluginBundle/Entity folder is
temporarily writeable by the web server.*
