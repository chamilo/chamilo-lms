Positioning
===

This plugin adds a positioning test tool in every course.
Positioning tests should be used before and after any course. One initial test should be taken before anything else is used in the course, and a final test (usually a copy of the same test) should be used at the end. A radar-chart will show the differences between the initial test and the final test for each learner.

For a test to be used as initial or final test, it has to match 3 criteria:
 - use at least 3 question categories
 - use the "radar" type result page
 - have only one available attempt
