Create a field to remedial course
======

The purpose of this plugin is the possibility of adding remedial courses or advanced courses so that, when a course is 
approved or failed, you can opt for a set of remedial courses or advanced courses.

* For remedial courses:
  When activating the plugin, in the test settings, a remedialCourseList field is enabled, where the course (s) to be 
  taken is established if the user fails all the course attempts.
  For this to work, the number of attempts must be activated and also, have an exam success rate enabled.
  After the user fails the last attempt, they automatically enroll in the selected courses.

* For advanced courses:
  When activating the plugin, in the test settings, the advanceCourseList field is enabled, which allows you to select 
  one or more courses that will be added to the user when they have passed an exam.
  This function is independent of the number of attempts, but the passing percentage must be established from the test 
  configuration.
