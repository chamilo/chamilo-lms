Your only concern must be that your users have the corresponding software to read them. Some file types can contain viruses, it is your responsibilty not to upload virus contaminated files, unless your portal admin has installed a server side anti=virus software.  It is, anyway, a worthwhile precaution to check documents with antivirus software before uploading them.</p><p>The documents are presented in alphabetical order.<br><br><b>Tip : </b>If you want to present them in a different order, numerate them: 01, 02, 03... Or use the Learning Path to present a sophisticated Table of Contents. Note that once your documents are uploaded, you may decide to hide the documents area and show only one page on Home page (Add link on home page orange tool) or a Learning Path containing some documents from your Documents area.</p><p>You can :</p><H4>Create a document</H4><p>Select Create a document > Give it a title (no spaces, no accents) > type your text > Use the buttons of the Wysiwyg (What You See Is What You Get) editor to structure information, create tables, styles etc. To create web pages, you will need to get familiar with 3 concepts : Links, Images and Tables. Note that web pages offer less layout possibilities than Ms-Word pages. Note too that instead of creating a document in the editor, you can also cut and paste existing content from a web page or a Word document. This is an easy and quick way to migrate content onto your Dokeos course.</p><ul><li><b>To add a link</b>, you need to copy the URL of the target somewhere. We suggest that you open 2 browser windows simultaneously, one with your dokeos course and the other to browse the web. Once you find the page you are looking for (note that this page can be inside your dokeos course), copy its URL (CTRL+C or APPLE+C), go back to your page editor, select the word that will be the link, click on the small chain icon, paste the URL of your target there and validate. Once your page is saved, test the link to see if it opens the target. Note that you can decide in the Link popup menu if the link will create a new page or replace your dokeos page in the same window.</li><li><b>To add an image</b>, the principle is similar to the link feature : browse the web with a 2nd window, find the image (if the image is inside your course\'s documents area, select \'No frames\' to get the image only and not the context), copy its URL (CTRL+C or APPLE+C in the URL bar after selecting the whole URL) then go back to your web page editor, position your mouse in the form where you want your image to appear, then click on the small tree icon and copy the URL of the target image into the URL field, Preview and validate. Note that in web pages, you can not redimension your images like in a PowerPoint presentation, neither can you re-locate the image anywhere in the page.</li><li><b>To add a table</b>, position your mouse in the field where you want the table to appear, then select the table icon in the Wysiwyg editor menu, decide for a number of columns and lines and validate. To get nice tables, we suggest that you choose the following values : border=1, cellspacing=0, cellpadding=4. Note that you will not be allowed to redimension your table or add lines or columns to it after its creation (sorry about this, it is just an online editor, not a word processor yet).</li></ul><h4>Upload a document</h4><ul>  <li>Select the file on your computer using the Browse button <input type=submit value=Browse name=submit2>	on the right of your screen.</li>		<li>			Launch the upload with the Upload Button <input type=submit value=Upload name=submit2>.		</li>		<li>			Check the checkbox under the Upload button if your document is zip file or a so-called <b>Scorm content</b>.

All items have a status :completed or incomplete, so the progress of students is clearly available.</p><p>If you alter the original title of a step, the new title will appear inthe path, but the original title will not be deleted. So if you wanttest8.doc to appear as \'Final Exam\' in the path, you do not have to renamethe file, you can use the new title in the path. It is also usefulto give new titles to links as they are too long.</p><p>When finished, do not forget to check the student view, where the table ofcontents appears on the left and the path steps usually appear on the right,one by one.</p><br><p><b>What is a Scorm or IMS format Learning path and how to upload (import) it?</b></p><p>The learning path tool allows you to upload SCORM and IMS compliant coursecontents.</p><p>SCORM  (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) is a public standard followed by major e-Learning actorslike NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft, etc. and acting at three levels:</p><ul><li><b>Economy</b> : Scorm allows whole courses or small contentunits to be reusable on different Learning Management Systems (LMS)through the separation of content and context,</li><li><b>Pedagogy</b> : Scorm integrates the notion ofpre-requisite or <i>sequencing</i> (<i>e.g. </i>\\\"Youcannot go to chapter 2 before passing Quiz 1\\\"),</li><li><b>Technology</b> : Scorm generates a table of contents asanabstraction layer situated outside content and outside the LMS. Ithelps content and LMS communicate with eachother. What is communicated is mainly <i>bookmarks</i>(\\\"Where is John in thecourse?\\\"), <i>scoring</i> (\\\"How did John pass the test?\\\") and <i>time</i> (\\\"How muchtime did John spent in chapter 1?\\\").</li></ul><b>How to create a SCORM compliant learning path?</b><br><br>The most natural way is to use the Dokeos Learning Path Builder. However, you may want to create complete Scorm compliant websites locally on your own computer before uploading it onto your dokeos platform. In this case, we recommend the use of a sophisticated tool like Lectora® or Reload®<br></p><p><b>Useful links</b><br><ul><li>Adlnet : authority responsible for Scorm normalisation, <ahref=\\\"http://www.adlnet.org/\\\">http://www.adlnet.org</a></li><li>Reload : Open Source free Scorm player and editor, <ahref=\\\"http://www.reload.ac.uk/\\\">http://www.reload.ac.uk</a></li><li>Lectora : Scorm publisher authoring software, <ahref=\\\"http://www.trivantis.com/\\\">http://www.trivantis.com</a><br><li>HotPotatoes home page, <a href=\\\"http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/halfbaked/\\\">http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/halfbaked/</a><br></li></ul><p><b>Note :</b></p><p>The Learning Path section lists all the <i>self-built Learning Paths</i>and all uploaded <i>Scorm format Learning Paths</i>, as well.</p>";

Keep files invisible if e.g. you ask the same question to everybody and want to avoid cheating. Making the documents invisible will also allow you to have some form of control before the document is made available to all the other students. </p><p>If you want that the students hand in a document that has to be evaluated then you\'d better define a directory inside this tool, which will offer you possibilities to define delivery and final dates, as well as a maximum grading score.</p><p>This tool has an <i>Introduction text</i> area to allow you to write a question, detailed guidelines, a reminder of a deadline or anything else you may find relevant.</p>";
