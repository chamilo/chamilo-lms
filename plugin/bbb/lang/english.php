If you don't have a BigBlueButton server, please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bigbluebutton.org/\">set one up</a> or ask the Chamilo official providers for a quote. BigBlueButton is a free (as in freedom *and* beer), but its installation requires a set of technical skills that might not be immediately available to all. You can install it on your own or seek professional help to assist you or do it for you. This help, however, will generate a certain cost. In the pure logic of the free software, we offer you the tools to make your work easier and recommend professionals (the Chamilo Official Providers) that will be able to help you if this were too difficult.<br />";
