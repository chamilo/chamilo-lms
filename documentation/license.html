    <p> GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />
      Version 2, June 1991</p>
    <p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />
      59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br />
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br />
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
    <p> Preamble</p>
    <p> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br />
      freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br />
      License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br />
      software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br />
      General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br />
      Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br />
      using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br />
      the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br />
      your programs, too.</p>
    <p> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br />
      price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br />
      have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br />
      this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br />
      if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br />
      in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
    <p> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br />
      anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br />
      These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br />
      distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
    <p> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br />
      gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br />
      you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br />
      source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br />
      rights.</p>
    <p> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br />
      (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br />
      distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
    <p> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br />
      that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br />
      software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br />
      want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br />
      that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br />
      authors' reputations.</p>
    <p> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br />
      patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br />
      program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br />
      program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br />
      patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
    <p> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br />
      modification follow.</p>
    <p> GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
    <p> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br />
      a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br />
      under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<br />
      refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<br />
      means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br />
      that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br />
      either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br />
      language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br />
      the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
    <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br />
      covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br />
      running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br />
      is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br />
      Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br />
      Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
    <p> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br />
      source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br />
      conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br />
      copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br />
      notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br />
      and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br />
      along with the Program.</p>
    <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br />
      you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
    <p> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br />
      of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br />
      distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br />
      above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
    <p> a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br />
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
    <p> b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br />
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br />
      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br />
      parties under the terms of this License.</p>
    <p> c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br />
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br />
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br />
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br />
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br />
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br />
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br />
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br />
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br />
      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>
    <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br />
      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br />
      and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br />
      themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br />
      sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br />
      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br />
      on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br />
      this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br />
      entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
    <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br />
      your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br />
      exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br />
      collective works based on the Program.</p>
    <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br />
      with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br />
      a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br />
      the scope of this License.</p>
    <p> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br />
      under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br />
      Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
    <p> a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br />
      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br />
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
    <p> b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br />
      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br />
      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br />
      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br />
      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br />
      customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
    <p> c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br />
      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br />
      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br />
      received the program in object code or executable form with such<br />
      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>
    <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br />
      making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br />
      code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br />
      associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br />
      control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br />
      special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br />
      anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br />
      form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br />
      operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br />
      itself accompanies the executable.</p>
    <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br />
      access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br />
      access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br />
      distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br />
      compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
    <p> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br />
      except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br />
      otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br />
      void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br />
      However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br />
      this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br />
      parties remain in full compliance.</p>
    <p> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br />
      signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br />
      distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br />
      prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br />
      modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br />
      Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br />
      all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br />
      the Program or works based on it.</p>
    <p> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br />
      Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br />
      original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br />
      these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br />
      restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br />
      You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br />
      this License.</p>
    <p> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br />
      infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br />
      conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />
      otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br />
      excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br />
      distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br />
      License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br />
      may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br />
      license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br />
      all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br />
      the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br />
      refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
    <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br />
      any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br />
      apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br />
      circumstances.</p>
    <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br />
      patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br />
      such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br />
      integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br />
      implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br />
      generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br />
      through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br />
      system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br />
      to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br />
      impose that choice.</p>
    <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br />
      be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
    <p> 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br />
      certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br />
      original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br />
      may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br />
      those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br />
      countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br />
      the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
    <p> 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br />
      of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br />
      be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br />
      address new problems or concerns.</p>
    <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br />
      specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<br />
      later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br />
      either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br />
      Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br />
      this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br />
      Foundation.</p>
    <p> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br />
      programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br />
      to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br />
      Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br />
      make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br />
      of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br />
      of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>
    <p> NO WARRANTY</p>
    <p> 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br />
      FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br />
      OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br />
      PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br />
      OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br />
      MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br />
      TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br />
      PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br />
      REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
    <p> 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br />
      WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br />
      REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br />
      INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br />
      OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br />
      TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br />
      YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br />
      PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br />
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
    <p> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
    <p> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p>
    <p> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br />
      possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br />
      free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
    <p> To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br />
      to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br />
      convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br />
      the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
    <p> &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br />
      Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</p>
    <p> This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br />
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br />
      the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br />
      (at your option) any later version.</p>
    <p> This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br />
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br />
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br />
      GNU General Public License for more details.</p>
    <p> You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br />
      along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br />
      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br />
    </p>
    <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
    <p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br />
      when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
    <p> Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br />
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br />
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br />
      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.</p>
    <p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br />
      parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may<br />
      be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br />
      mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</p>
    <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br />
      school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if<br />
      necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
    <p> Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br />
      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.</p>
    <p> &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br />
      Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>
    <p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br />
      proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br />
      consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br />
      library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br />
      Public License instead of this License.<br />
