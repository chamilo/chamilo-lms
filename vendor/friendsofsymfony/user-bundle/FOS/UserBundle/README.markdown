FOSUserBundle
=============

The FOSUserBundle adds support for a database-backed user system in Symfony2.
It provides a flexible framework for user management that aims to handle
common tasks such as user registration and password retrieval.

Features include:

- Users can be stored via Doctrine ORM, MongoDB/CouchDB ODM or Propel
- Registration support, with an optional confirmation per email
- Password reset support
- Unit tested

**Note:** This bundle does *not* provide an authentication system but can
provide the user provider for the core [SecurityBundle](https://symfony.com/doc/current/book/security.html).

**Caution:** This bundle is developed in sync with [symfony's repository](https://github.com/symfony/symfony).
For Symfony 2.0.x, you need to use the 1.2.0 release of the bundle (or lower)
